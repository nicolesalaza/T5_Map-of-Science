TI  - Diagnosis and Treatment of Parkinson Disease: A Review.
PG  - 548-560
LID - 10.1001/jama.2019.22360 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Parkinson disease is the most common form of parkinsonism, a group of 
      neurological disorders with Parkinson disease-like movement problems such as 
      rigidity, slowness, and tremor. More than 6 million individuals worldwide have 
      Parkinson disease. OBSERVATIONS: Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history 
      and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement 
      sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation), characteristic movement difficulty 
      (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, 
      cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates 
      bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon 
      emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence 
      of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with 
      different prognoses. Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype (9%-16% of 
      individuals with Parkinson disease) have prominent early motor and nonmotor 
      symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals 
      with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease (49%-53% of individuals with Parkinson 
      disease) have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications (eg, 
      carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists), and slower disease progression. Other 
      individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with Parkinson disease, 
      treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg, tremor, rigidity, 
      bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs and 
      symptoms. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available. 
      Dopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms 
      require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for 
      psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative 
      therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic treatments. Individuals experiencing 
      complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a 
      medication dose wears off ("off periods"), medication-resistant tremor, and 
      dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy with 
      levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation. Palliative care is 
      part of Parkinson disease management. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease 
      is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive forms. Treatment 
      involves pharmacologic approaches (typically with levodopa preparations prescribed 
      with or without other medications) and nonpharmacologic approaches (such as exercise 
      and physical, occupational, and speech therapies). Approaches such as deep brain 
      stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help 
      individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication 
      wears off, and dyskinesias.

PG  - 1589-1599
LID - 10.1001/jama.2019.4782 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Worldwide, 47 million people live with dementia and, by 2050, the number 
      is expected to increase to 131 million. OBSERVATIONS: Dementia is an acquired loss 
      of cognition in multiple cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect social or 
      occupational function. In the United States, Alzheimer disease, one cause of 
      dementia, affects 5.8 million people. Dementia is commonly associated with more than 
      1 neuropathology, usually Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular pathology. 
      Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive decline and 
      impairment in daily activities, with corroboration from a close friend or family 
      member, in addition to a thorough mental status examination by a clinician to 
      delineate impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as 
      spatial orientation, executive function, and mood. Brief cognitive impairment 
      screening questionnaires can assist in initiating and organizing the cognitive 
      assessment. However, if the assessment is inconclusive (eg, symptoms present, but 
      normal examination findings), neuropsychological testing can help determine whether 
      dementia is present. Physical examination may help identify the etiology of 
      dementia. For example, focal neurologic abnormalities suggest stroke. Brain 
      neuroimaging may demonstrate structural changes including, but not limited to, focal 
      atrophy, infarcts, and tumor, that may not be identified on physical examination. 
      Additional evaluation with cerebrospinal fluid assays or genetic testing may be 
      considered in atypical dementia cases, such as age of onset younger than 65 years, 
      rapid symptom onset, and/or impairment in multiple cognitive domains but not 
      episodic memory. For treatment, patients may benefit from nonpharmacologic 
      approaches, including cognitively engaging activities such as reading, physical 
      exercise such as walking, and socialization such as family gatherings. Pharmacologic 
      approaches can provide modest symptomatic relief. For Alzheimer disease, this 
      includes an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as donepezil for mild to severe 
      dementia, and memantine (used alone or as an add-on therapy) for moderate to severe 
      dementia. Rivastigmine can be used to treat symptomatic Parkinson disease dementia. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Alzheimer disease currently affects 5.8 million persons 
      in the United States and is a common cause of dementia, which is usually accompanied 
      by other neuropathology, often cerebrovascular disease such as brain infarcts. 
      Causes of dementia can be diagnosed by medical history, cognitive and physical 
      examination, laboratory testing, and brain imaging. Management should include both 
      nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches, although efficacy of available 
      treatments remains limited.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Depression is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson disease (PD), 
      occurring in approximately 20% of patients with PD. While depression can occur 
      anytime in the disease process, it predates PD diagnosis in about 30% of patients. 
      Between 20% and 60% of depressed patients with PD are either without recognition or 
      treatment of their depression. AREAS COVERED: The pathophysiology of depression in 
      PD is unclear. There are several structural changes seen in depressed patients with 
      PD that are also seen in patients with depression. In addition, the 
      neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine are all depleted in PD. 
      This article covers the pharmacological treatment of depression in PD; this involves 
      standard antidepressant treatment such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
      tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors. As with depression not associated with PD, most 
      treatment is partially successful. Non-pharmacological approaches are also touched 
      upon. EXPERT OPINION: Most antidepressant therapy shows partial efficacy in patients 
      with PD. However, there is a need for better study design as well as more 
      comparative studies for the treatment of depression in PD. Biomarkers will help 
      identify patients with PD and depression earlier in the future.

AB  - Neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), have increased in 
      prevalence and are expected to further increase in the coming decades. In this 
      regard, PD affects around 3% of the population by age 65 and up to 5% of people over 
      the age of 85. PD is a widely described, physically and mentally disabling 
      neurodegenerative disorder. One symptom often poorly recognized and under-treated by 
      health care providers despite being reported as the most common non-motor symptom is 
      the finding of chronic pain. Compared to the general population of similar age, PD 
      patients suffer from a significantly higher level and prevalence of pain. The most 
      common form of pain reported by Parkinson's patients is of musculoskeletal origin. 
      One of the most used combination drugs for PD is Levodopa-Carbidopa, a dopamine 
      precursor that is converted to dopamine by the action of a naturally occurring 
      enzyme called DOPA decarboxylase. Pramipexole, a D2 dopamine agonist, and 
      apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, and Rotigotine, a dopamine receptor agonist, have 
      showed efficacy on PD-associated pain. Other treatments that have shown efficacy in 
      treating pain of diverse etiologies are acetaminophen, Nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. Opioids 
      and opioid-like medications such as oxycodone, morphine, tramadol, and codeine are 
      also commonly employed in treatment of chronic pain in PD. Other opioid related 
      medications such as Tapentadol, a central-acting oral analgesic with combined opioid 
      and noradrenergic properties, and Targinact, a combination of the opioid agonist 
      oxycodone and the opioid antagonist naloxone have shown improvement in pain. 
      Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin, pregabalin, lamotrigine, carbamazepine and 
      tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can be trialed when attempting to manage chronic 
      pain in PD. The selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
      also possess pain relieving and antidepressant properties, but carry less of the 
      risk of anticholinergic side effects seen in TCAs. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of 
      the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown in multiple studies to be effective 
      against various types of PD associated pain symptoms. Massage therapy (MT) is one of 
      the most common forms of complementary and alternative medicine. Studies have shown 
      that pressure applied during MT may stimulate vagal activity, promoting reduced 
      anxiety and pain, as well as increasing levels of serotonin. In a survey study of PD 
      patients, rehabilitative therapy and physical therapy were rated as the most 
      effective for pain reduction, though with only temporary relief but these studies 
      were uncontrolled. Yoga has been studied for patients with a wide array of 
      neurological disorders. In summary, PD pathology is thought to have a modulating 
      effect on pain sensation, which could amplify pain. This could help explain a 
      portion of the higher incidence of chronic pain felt by PD patients. A treatment 
      plan can be devised that may include dopaminergic agents, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, 
      opioids, antidepressants, physical therapies, DBS and other options discussed in 
      this review. A thorough assessment of patient history and physical examination 
      should be made in patients with PD so chronic pain may be managed effectively.

AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) are Lewy 
      body-related neurodegenerative disorders sharing common clinical and 
      neuropathological findings. The clinical features of both conditions include 
      cognitive impairment, behavioral symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, 
      and parkinsonism. The cognitive profile of both disorders is characterized by 
      particularly severe deficits in executive and visuospatial functions as well as 
      attention. Clinical differentiation between DLB and PD-D is based on an arbitrary 
      distinction between the time of onset of parkinsonism and cognitive symptoms; 
      extrapyramidal symptoms precede dementia in PD-D, whereas it coincides with or 
      follows dementia within 1 year in DLB. When the clinical picture is fully developed, 
      DLB and PD-D are practically indistinguishable. Although the diagnosis is basically 
      clinical, structural and functional neuroimaging as well as cerebrospinal fluid 
      biomarkers may help the clinician in the diagnosis. Placebo-controlled randomized 
      trials of the cholinesterase inhibitors have shown modest but significant benefits 
      in cognition, global function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in both disorders. 
      Behavioral symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions should be treated with 
      caution with antipsychotics, as they have the potential to worsen motor and 
      cognitive symptoms.

AB  - BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) was initially cloned 
      and characterized in 1999. It is required for the generation of all monomeric forms 
      of amyloid-β (Aβ), including Aβ(42), which aggregates into bioactive conformational 
      species and likely initiates toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 
      concentrations and rates of activity are increased in AD brains and body fluids, 
      thereby supporting the hypothesis that BACE1 plays a critical role in AD 
      pathophysiology. Therefore, BACE1 is a prime drug target for slowing down Aβ 
      production in early AD. Besides the amyloidogenic pathway, BACE1 has other 
      substrates that may be important for synaptic plasticity and synaptic homeostasis. 
      Indeed, germline and adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice display complex 
      neurological phenotypes. Despite BACE1 inhibitor clinical trials conducted so far 
      being discontinued for futility or safety reasons, BACE1 remains a well-validated 
      therapeutic target for AD. A safe and efficacious compound with high substrate 
      selectivity as well as a more accurate dose regimen, patient population, and disease 
      stage may yet be found. Further research should focus on the role of Aβ and BACE1 in 
      physiological processes and key pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. The functions 
      of BACE1 and the homologue BACE2, as well as the biology of Aβ in neurons and glia, 
      deserve further investigation. Cellular and molecular studies of BACE1 and BACE2 
      knockout mice coupled with biomarker-based human research will help elucidate the 
      biological functions of these important enzymes and identify their substrates and 
      downstream effects. Such studies will have critical implications for BACE1 
      inhibition as a therapeutic approach for AD.

AB  - In recent years, numerous clinical trials for disease modification in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) have failed, possibly because of a "one-size-fits all" approach. 
      Alternatively, a precision medicine approach, which customises treatments based on 
      patients' individual genotype, may help reach disease modification. Here, we review 
      clinical trials that target genetic forms of PD, i.e., GBA-associated and 
      LRRK2-associated PD. In summary, six ongoing studies which explicitely recruit 
      GBA-PD patients, and two studies which recruit LRRK2-PD patients, were identified. 
      Available data on mechanisms of action, study design, and challenges of therapeutic 
      trials are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is 
      characterized by the combination of motor and non-motor symptoms. As yet, there is 
      no curative treatment. The gold standard for symptom control is levodopa. Two years 
      after the start of substitution therapy, around 50% of patients experience some 
      degree of fluctuation in motor performance. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
      inhibitors are important agents in treating these fluctuations.Areas covered: This 
      article summarizes our knowledge about a new third-generation COMT inhibitor, namely 
      opicapone (OPC) (Search period: 2016-2019). The authors detail the pharmacological 
      profile of OPC and summarize the results of completed clinical trials. In addition, 
      they briefly summarize the achievements of the past few years.Expert opinion: Based 
      on clinical trials conducted so far, OPC is an effective and safe new drug. In 
      comparison to entacapone and tolcapone, it does not require close laboratory 
      monitoring or multiple oral administrations, which may result in better adherence. 
      No serious adverse event was reported during the drug development phases. Dyskinesia 
      was the most common complaint. Further comparative studies and broader trial 
      inclusion criteria are needed to help the decision between COMT inhibitors and to 
      expand the patient spectrum where this drug can be applied.

PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2021.1929217 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Levodopa formulations are the workhorses of the labor against motor 
      symptoms management in Parkinson's disease (PD). Progression of PD on levodopa 
      inevitably leads to motor fluctuations. It is important to understand the safety and 
      efficacy of opicapone, the most recent addition to the clinician's armamentarium 
      against these fluctuations.Materials and methods: We review the development of COMT 
      inhibitors in the treatment of PD as well as the efficacy and safety data reported 
      in the currently published literature of opicapone in PD. The "currently published 
      literature" is defined as all published, PubMed indexed trials including the word 
      "opicapone." Finally, we compare opicapone to the competitor pharmaceuticals on the 
      market to treat symptom fluctuations in PD and share our opinion of opicapone's 
      place in clinical practice.Results: From the reported results of phase 3 and 4 
      trials of opicapone in PD, it is a safe and efficacious option to combat motor 
      fluctuations for our PD patients taking levodopa. A reduction of "off" time by up to 
      1 h per day can be expected, increasing "on" time with fewer dyskinesias. Opicapone 
      is not generally hepatotoxic, and the most reported side-effects-dyskinesia, dry 
      mouth, dizziness, diarrhea, and constipation-were seen in only 1.4% of the OPTIPARK 
      (a large phase 4 clinical trial) study population.Conclusions: One should consider 
      utilizing opicapone, perhaps in combination with other augmenting medications with 
      different mechanisms of action, to help treat motor and non-motor fluctuations in 
      PD.

BTI - Dementia -- Caring, Ethics, Ethnical and Economical Aspects: A Systematic Review
AB  - (3 VOLUMES): PURPOSE: The purpose of this SBU project was to use systematic database 
      searches and a review of the scientific literature as a starting point to assess the 
      current state of knowledge about dementia disorders from various perspectives. Those 
      perspectives included occurrence, risk factors for development, diagnostics, care, 
      ethical considerations, ethnicity and drug therapies, as well as the health economic 
      aspects. OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT: The objective of the report is to: Analyse current 
      knowledge and values about caregiving in order to help caregivers of dementia 
      patients. Support nurses and caregivers in diagnosing and treating people with 
      dementia disorders. Describe the key role of family members in caring for people 
      with dementia. Provide public officials and other decision makers with a scientific 
      basis for formulating dementia care policy. SBU’S CONCLUSIONS: OCCURRENCE, RISK AND 
      PREVENTION: Two thirds of the approximately 140,000 Swedes with a dementia disorder 
      have Alzheimer’s disease. The other two leading disorders are vascular dementia 
      (10%) and frontotemporal dementia (5%). Other disorders occur in various 
      combinations with non-dementia conditions, such as the frequent comorbidity of Lewy 
      body dementia and Parkinson’s disease. A common denominator of all dementia 
      disorders is that memory and cognitive function is impaired due to neuron death. Age 
      is the primary risk factor for developing dementia (strong scientific evidence). 
      Rising life expectancies are increasing the number of people who develop dementia 
      disorders. Approximately 1% of 65-year-olds and more than 50% of 90-year-olds have a 
      dementia disorder. Among people older than 85, a greater percentage of women than 
      men have Alzheimer’s disease (moderately strong scientific evidence). Although known 
      genetic changes that cause Alzheimer’s disease are rare, the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 
      ε4 allele is known to increase the risk (strong scientific evidence). Currently, 
      there is no specific preventive treatment for dementia, but blood pressure 
      monitoring in middle age reduces the risk of developing it later in life (moderately 
      strong scientific evidence). Treatment with antihypertensives reduces the risk of 
      developing vascular dementia later in life (moderately strong scientific evidence). 
      The progression of dementia can be delayed among older people who continue to lead 
      active lives (moderately strong scientific evidence). RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER 
      DISEASES: Cognitive deterioration due to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is 
      unrelated to dementia but needs to be diagnosed and treated. Existing studies show 
      contradictory results with respect to the cor- relation between low vitamin B(12) 
      (cobalamin) levels and impaired cognitive function or Alzheimer’s disease. There is 
      a moderate corre- lation between low folic acid levels and impaired cognitive 
      function. There is a strong correlation between high homocysteine levels and 
      impaired cognitive function. Treatment with vitamins such as cobalamin or folic acid 
      that lower homocysteine levels does not lead to any improvement in impaired 
      cognitive function. DIAGNOSIS: Currently, there is no simple, reliable test for 
      identifying dementia at an early stage. In their present form, no diagnostic 
      instruments are sufficiently developed to be used for dementia screening. A gold 
      standard is lacking for identifying dementia and ruling out other diseases. 
      Imprecise definitions of the various dementia disorders limit the ability of 
      caregivers to distinguish one disorder from another. Many methods (scales and 
      indices) are used to measure the severity of various symptoms of dementia, such as 
      cognitive deterioration, functional decline and behavioural changes. The 
      insufficient evaluation to which most methods have been subjected makes it more 
      difficult to assess the efficacy of specific care and treatment approaches. Family, 
      friends and caregivers (knowledgeable informants/collateral sources) can provide 
      valuable information to supplement diagnosis and the patient’s narrative. 
      Standardised interviews with collateral sources (moderately strong scientific 
      evidence), as well as the clock drawing test and other simple exercises (moderately 
      strong scientific evidence), allow general practitioners to perform an initial 
      selection of patients for possible further diagnosis. After a baseline assessment, 
      detection of atrophy of the medial temporal lobe by computer tomography (CT scan) 
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan), respectively can identify people who have 
      Alzheimer’s disease with a high degree of certainty (strong scientific evidence). 
      After a baseline assessment, biochemical diagnostic markers such as cerebrospinal 
      fluid analysis (strong scientific evidence) and neuropsychological testing (strong 
      scientific evidence) effectively identify people with Alzheimer’s disease. 
      Functional diagnosis – positron emission tomography (PET scan) and single photon 
      emission computed tomography (SPECT scan) – has moderate value (moderately strong 
      scientific evidence), while neurophysiological testing – EEG brain mapping and 
      quantitative EEG – has limited value (limited scientific evidence) for identifying 
      dementia disorders. The apoliprotein E ε4 is a poor marker for the ApoE ε4 allele 
      for identifying Alzheimer’s disease or for differential diagnosis. Studies are 
      lacking that have combined different types of testing. As a result, which approaches 
      are most cost-effective is not known with certainty. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND 
      ATTITUDES: Because dementia affects almost all areas of life, ethical issues often 
      arise. Values and beliefs – including views about the human con- dition and the 
      appropriateness of various interventions – influence diagnosis, care and treatment 
      alike. The issues are rarely simple or uncomplicated, but tend to require active 
      moral reflection based on both knowledge and subjective principles. People with 
      dementia are sometimes stigmatised. Greater under- standing and candour can lead to 
      more objective and compassionate social attitudes. Dementia care varies considerably 
      from one Swedish county and municipality to another. The results of the literature 
      search should be used, particularly by the municipalities, for the benefit of 
      patients and their families. CARING FOR PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA: In addition to 
      knowledge and objectivity, effective care requires a trusting relationship between 
      the patient and caregiver. Because the studies that have assessed various kinds of 
      care do not generally control for or evaluate the impact of that relationship, the 
      benefits of a particular approach are difficult to determine. Substantial variations 
      with regard to purpose, type of intervention and assessment instrument hamper 
      attempts to summarise the studies as a single evidence grade. A number of studies, 
      though with generally low internal validity, have demonstrated the efficacy of 
      various interventions – such as multisensory stimulation (Snoezelen), music and 
      reminiscence therapy – for improving the quality of life of individual patients. 
      Many studies have looked at training programmes and clinical guidance for nurses and 
      caregivers. But given that the studies do not meet suitable criteria for assessing 
      evidence, the most effective approach cannot be identified. Generally speaking, 
      nurses and caregivers need support in the form of training. Dementia affects the 
      lives of family members as well as the patient. Psychosocial training programmes 
      (moderately strong scientific evidence) for family members, along with instruction 
      in dealing with the behavioural problems that accompany dementia (limited scientific 
      evidence), can alleviate their anxiety and depression. While good quality of life is 
      a vital objective in caring for people with dementia, effective methods are lacking 
      for evaluating quality of life from the patient’s point of view. Existing studies 
      have not found that respite care reduces the community resources that must be 
      devoted to people with dementia or the anxiety experienced by family members. But it 
      offers family members the opportunity to obtain some valuable relief. DRUG 
      THERAPIES: Existing studies have not found that treatment with cholinesterase 
      inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) affects the progress of mild to 
      moderate Alzheimer’s disease. But it offers some improvement of global function and 
      cognition (moderately strong scientific evidence). However, knowledge about effects 
      for longer than one year is limited. Treatment of mild to severe Alzheimer’s disease 
      with memantine can lead to some cognitive improvement (limited scientific evidence). 
      Knowledge about long-term effects is limited to therapy for six months. Extract of 
      Ginkgo biloba can provide some relief of cognitive and Activities of Daily Living 
      (ADL) impairment (limited scientific evidence). Knowledge about long-term effects is 
      limited to therapy for six months. Cholinesterase inhibitors commonly cause the 
      adverse effects of dizziness and nausea (moderately strong scientific evidence). A 
      number of drug groups, such as benzodiazepines and anticholi- nergics, have 
      undesired effects on cognition (strong scientific evidence). People with dementia 
      disorders commonly develop depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
      (SSRIs) can provide some relief. The scientific evidence for treating coexisting 
      depression in people with dementia is however limited (limited scientific evidence). 
      Drug therapies for behavioural symptoms in people with dementia disorders have 
      limited effectiveness (limited scientific evidence). Increased mortality has been 
      demonstrated in people with dementia who have been treated with atypical 
      antipsychotics. The impact on mortality has not shown up in individual studies but 
      was identified by a meta-analysis (moderately strong scientific evidence). 
      Corresponding data is lacking concerning older antipsychotics. The health economic 
      studies published so far suffer from methodological flaws and are not conclusive. 
      Because only a few studies contain empirical data, determining whether drug therapy 
      is cost-effective or not is difficult. SOCIAL IMPACT: Approximately half of all 
      people with dementia move to assisted living facilities within 2–3 years after 
      diagnosis. Approximately half of all people with dementia are in assisted living 
      facilities. The burden of dementia in Sweden corresponds to approximately sek 40 
      billion (eur 4.36 billion) a year, a figure that is likely to grow as the size of 
      the elderly population continues to increase. Municipalities bear more than 80% of 
      the costs, which cover care at assisted living facilities and support for those who 
      remain at home. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NEEDS: Additional research on dementia disorders 
      is required in several areas: How the various disorders progress. Development of 
      diagnostic methods. Better evaluation of instruments for identifying and measuring 
      cognitive and related symptoms, as well as assessing the quality of life of people 
      with dementia. Development of caregiving methods, such as guidance, training and 
      studies that focus on the relationship between patient and caregiver. Clearer 
      ethical guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and care of people with dementia. Drugs 
      for all categories of dementia that are more effective and cause fewer adverse 
      effects. Studies that examine the long-term effects and costs of drug therapies.

AB  - Major and minor forms of depression are significant contributors to Parkinson's 
      disease morbidity and caregiver burden, affecting up to 50% of these patients. 
      Nonetheless, symptoms of depression are still underrecognized and undertreated in 
      this context due to scarcity of evidence and, consequently, consistent clinical 
      guideline recommendations. Here, we carried out a prospective, multicentre, 2-round 
      modified Delphi survey with 49 questions about the aetiopathological mechanisms of 
      depression in Parkinson's disease (10), clinical features and connections with motor 
      and nonmotor symptoms (10), diagnostic criteria (5), and therapeutic options (24). 
      Items were assessed by a panel of 37 experts (neurologists, psychiatrists, and a 
      geriatrist), and consensus was achieved in 81.6% of them. Depressive symptoms, 
      enhanced by multiple patient circumstances, were considered Parkinson's disease risk 
      factors but not clinical indicators of motor symptom and disease progression. These 
      patients should be systematically screened for depression while ruling out both 
      anhedonia and apathy symptoms as they are not necessarily linked to it. Clinical 
      scales (mainly the Geriatric Depression Scale GDS-15) can help establishing the 
      diagnosis of depression, the symptoms of which will require treatment regardless of 
      severity. Efficacious and well-tolerated pharmacological options for Parkinson's 
      comorbid depression were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (especially 
      sertraline), dual-action serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
      (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine), multimodal (vortioxetine, bupropion, 
      mirtazapine, and tianeptine), and anti-Parkinsonian dopamine agonists (pramipexole, 
      ropinirole, and rotigotine). Tricyclic antidepressants and combining type B 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors with serotonergic drugs have serious side effects in 
      these patients and therefore should not be prescribed. Electroconvulsive therapy was 
      indicated for severe and drug-refractory cases. Cognitive behavioural therapy was 
      recommended in cases of mild depression. Results presented here are useful 
      diagnostic and patient management guidance for other physicians and important 
      considerations to improve future drug trial design.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative central nervous system 
      (CNS) disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration with consequent 
      reduction in striatal dopamine (DA) levels that leads to motor symptoms. 
      Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, E.C 2.1.1.6) inactivates dopamine and other 
      substrates bearing catechol through the methylation of a hydroxyl group. COMT 
      inhibition can block metabolism of catecholamines including DA. Since the increase 
      in DA bioavailability is dependent on the inhibition of DA metabolism at the 
      periphery, the development of COMT inhibitors as adjuvants to levodopa/aromatic 
      amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor treatment improves the clinical benefits 
      of PD symptomatic treatment significantly.Areas covered: This review focuses on the 
      contribution of computational studies to develop novel COMT inhibitors as 
      therapeutics of Parkinson's disease with substantially improved efficacy.Expert 
      opinion: The increasing use of in silico methods and the development of new 
      chemoinformatic tools in combination with the knowledge gained from the development 
      of different inhibitors studied both in silico, in vitro and in vivo, could help 
      solve a number of issues related to the shortcomings of currently marketed 
      treatments. They can also aid to open new avenues for centrally acting COMT 
      inhibitors, and perhaps irreversible inhibitors, to be tested for PD and other 
      neurological diseases.

PG  - 45

LID - 45
AB  - Urogenital dysfunction is commonly reported in Parkinson's disease (PD), and history 
      taking and a bladder diary form the cornerstone of evaluation. The assessment of 
      lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms include urinalysis, ultrasonography, and 
      urodynamic studies and help to evaluate concomitant urological pathologies such as 
      benign prostate enlargement. Antimuscarinic medications are the first line treatment 
      for overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms and solifenacin has been specifically studied 
      in PD. Antimuscarininc drugs may exacerbate PD-related constipation and xerostomia, 
      and caution is advised when using these medications in individuals where cognitive 
      impairment is suspected. Desmopressin is effective for the management of nocturnal 
      polyuria which has been reported to be common in PD. Intradetrusor injections of 
      botulinum toxin have been shown to be effective for detrusor overactivity, however, 
      are associated with the risk of urinary retention. Neuromodulation is a promising, 
      minimally invasive treatment for PD-related OAB symptoms. Erectile dysfunction is 
      commonly reported and first line treatments include phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. 
      A patient-tailored approach is required for the optimal management of urogenital 
      dysfunction in PD.

TI  - Defining the Role of the Monoamine Oxidase-B Inhibitors for Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - 433-41
LID - 10.1007/s40263-015-0249-8 [doi]
AB  - Inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) occupy an important place in the treatment 
      of Parkinson's disease. Selegiline was the first MAO-B to be used therapeutically, 
      while rasagiline is a second-generation drug with higher potency and selectivity. 
      Safinamide is an investigational MAO-B inhibitor with non-dopaminergic properties 
      that may provide advantages over its predecessors. As a class, MAO-B inhibitors are 
      safe and well tolerated and provide symptomatic benefit both as monotherapy and in 
      combination with other antiparkinsonian medications from early to late stages of 
      disease. In combination with levodopa, MAO-B inhibitors may improve motor 
      fluctuations and allow for lower total doses of levodopa. Patient characteristics 
      and preferences can be important factors in deciding between agents. As a class, 
      MAO-B inhibitors have shown promise as disease-modifying agents, but the clinical 
      trial evidence to date has not been strong enough to afford them such a label. 
      Future research may help further elucidate their relative merits and clarify their 
      role in altering disease progression.

TI  - Chronic Hiccups.
LID - 10.1007/s11938-020-00273-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nearly 4000 patients will be admitted to hospital in the US this 
      year for hiccups. Hiccups are controlled by a complex reflex arc between peripheral 
      receptors and the brainstem. Any disruption along this pathway may produce hiccups. 
      Typically, hiccups resolve spontaneously but in certain pathologies symptoms may 
      persist. Persistent hiccups may be considered a sign of underlying pathology. The 
      most common cause involves GERD. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on etiologies, studies have 
      shown that first-line therapy should use a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and involve 
      appropriate gastrointestinal consultation. If symptoms persist, other etiologies 
      such as central causes need to be explored. We review the pathophysiology of hiccups 
      including multiple causes and the appropriate work up for each. We review several 
      studies examining new treatments, both pharmacological and interventional, that may 
      help patients. Initial therapy should still involve a PPI but several new therapies 
      may be beneficial.

TI  - Approach to Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - 1495-1510
LID - 10.1007/s13311-020-00963-x [doi]
AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and predicts poor 
      clinical outcomes. It is associated primarily with pathologic involvement of basal 
      forebrain cholinergic and prefrontal dopaminergic systems. Impairments in executive 
      functions, attention, and visuospatial abilities are its hallmark features with 
      eventual involvement of memory and other domains. Subtle symptoms in the premotor 
      and early phases of PD progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which may be 
      present at the time of diagnosis. Eventually, a large majority of PD patients 
      develop dementia with advancing age and longer disease duration, which is usually 
      accompanied by immobility, hallucinations/psychosis, and dysautonomia. Dopaminergic 
      medications and deep brain stimulation help motor dysfunction, but may have 
      potential cognitive side effects. Central acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and 
      possibly memantine, provide modest and temporary symptomatic relief for dementia, 
      although there is no evidence-based treatment for MCI. There is no proven 
      disease-modifying treatment for cognitive impairment in PD. The symptomatic and 
      disease-modifying role of physical exercise, cognitive training, and neuromodulation 
      on cognitive impairment in PD is under investigation. Multidisciplinary approaches 
      to cognitive impairment with effective treatment of comorbidities, proper 
      rehabilitation, and maintenance of good support systems in addition to 
      pharmaceutical treatment may improve the quality of life of the patients and 
      caregivers.

TI  - GRN Frontotemporal Dementia.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The spectrum of GRN frontotemporal dementia (GRN-FTD) 
      includes the behavioral variant (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA; further 
      subcategorized as progressive nonfluent aphasia [PNFA] and semantic dementia [SD]), 
      and movement disorders with extrapyramidal features such as parkinsonism and 
      corticobasal syndrome (CBS). A broad range of clinical features both within and 
      between families is observed. The age of onset ranges from 35 to 87 years. 
      Behavioral disturbances are the most common early feature, followed by progressive 
      aphasia. Impairment in executive function manifests as loss of judgment and insight. 
      In early stages, PPA often manifests as deficits in naming, word finding, or word 
      comprehension. In late stages, affected individuals often become mute and lose their 
      ability to communicate. Early findings of parkinsonism include rigidity, 
      bradykinesia or akinesia (slowing or absence of movements), limb dystonia, apraxia 
      (loss of ability to carry out learned purposeful movements), and disequilibrium. 
      Late motor findings may include myoclonus, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Most affected 
      individuals eventually lose the ability to walk. Disease duration is three to 12 
      years. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of GRN-FTD is established in a proband with 
      suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in GRN identified by 
      molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Behavioral 
      manifestations such as apathy, impulsivity, and compulsiveness may respond to 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Roaming, delusions, and hallucinations may 
      respond to antipsychotic medications. Reports have suggested potential benefits with 
      certain pharmacotherapy on management of FTD; however, evidence from randomized 
      controlled trials is limited. Small-scale studies have suggested that trazodone may 
      be helpful for treating irritability, agitation, depression, and eating disorders; 
      methylphenidate and dextro-amphetamine may help minimize risk-taking behavior. 
      Cholinesterase inhibitors examined in clinical trials were generally well tolerated: 
      galantamine was used to treat PPA with stabilization of symptoms; rivastigmine was 
      used to treat behavioral manifestations and appeared to decrease caregiver burden. 
      Two open-label studies of memantine, an NMDA partial agonist-antagonist, 
      demonstrated some efficacy on frontal behavior in those with bvFTD and improvement 
      in cognitive performance in those with PPA-PNFA. GENETIC COUNSELING: GRN-FTD is 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. About 95% of individuals diagnosed with 
      GRN-FTD have an affected parent. The proportion of affected individuals with a de 
      novo GRN pathogenic variant is unknown but is estimated to be 5% or fewer. Each 
      child of an individual with GRN-FTD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic 
      variant. Once a GRN pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family 
      member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation 
      genetic testing are possible.

AB  - As per recent reports, there is an association between glucocerebrosidase (Gcase) 
      enzyme and Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, certain mutations in the Gcase 
      gene (GBA) and the progranulin (PGRN) gene are found to be linked with the imbalance 
      in the levels of Gcase enzyme. This imbalance or decrease or impairment in Gcase 
      activity can lead to Gaucher disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 
      dementia, etc. Recent evidences suggest that the drugs used to treat these diseases 
      can be used for PD. The present review has focused on the therapeutic approaches 
      used for diseases linked with Gcase enzyme, which can be used for PD. The review 
      also considered possible target specific novel strategies, which may help to meet 
      the unmet needs in the treatment of PD.

TI  - Impulsive and compulsive behaviors during dopamine replacement treatment in 
      Parkinson's Disease and other disorders.
PG  - 63-75
AB  - Impulsive and compulsive behaviors, including pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, 
      compulsive shopping, compulsive eating, excessive engagement in hobbies, punding, 
      and Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS), are increasingly reported serious 
      side-effects of dopaminergic medication, used in the treatment of Parkinson's 
      Disease (PD) and other disorders. Dopamine Agonists (DA) are strongly related with 
      Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs), while L-dopa is associated with DDS. The present 
      paper focuses on ICDs. The estimated prevalence of ICDs in PD patients treated with 
      DA is as high as 14%. ICDs pathophysiology is complex, due to multiple contributing 
      factors. Dopamine neurotransmission along the meso-cortico-limbic pathway is a 
      modulator of risk behavior and can be altered in PD and in the course of 
      dopaminergic treatment. Psychiatric complications, associated with treatment of PD 
      are still underdiagnosed, although their consequences can be serious, even 
      catastrophic. Physicians treating PD with DA should warn the patients and their 
      relatives of the risk of inducing ICDs. Psychiatrists should be trained to recognize 
      these side effects, that can mimic primary psychiatric conditions. The management of 
      ICDs includes discontinuation of DA or switching from DA to other drugs for the 
      treatment of PD. Cognitive behavior therapy, serotonin selective reuptake 
      inhibitors, nalmefene, zonisamide, low dose of anti-dopaminergic drugs, as 
      quetiapine or clozapine, can be effective. Psychological, spiritual, and ethical 
      support (familial or individual) can help.

TI  - Depression in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - Depression is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and its identification and 
      treatment are critically important in disease management. Despite depression's high 
      prevalence and major impact on patient quality of life, questions remain regarding 
      its epidemiology and preferred treatment. The authors of this paper summarize 
      available information on the epidemiology of depression in PD, review treatment 
      options, and discuss possible interactions between antidepressants and other agents. 
      This information may help guide clinical treatment and define the need for further 
      studies.

AB  - Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from a heterogeneous expression of 
      neurotransmitter deficits. They cause an individual variable expression of motor and 
      non-motor symptoms. Thus, drugs with various mechanisms of actions are suitable to 
      counteract these disease related neurotransmitter alterations. Areas covered: This 
      invited review suggests safinamide as an ideal compound for therapy of Parkinson's 
      disease, as its pharmacological profile includes reversible monoamine oxidase B 
      inhibition, blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels, modulation of calcium 
      channels and abnormal glutamate release. Safinamide may provide benefits effects on 
      non-motor symptoms in addition to the demonstrated amelioration of motor impairment 
      in levodopa treated patients with Parkinson's disease. Safinamide was well tolerated 
      and safe when administered in dose of 50 or 100 mg daily in pivotal trials. Expert 
      opinion: Clinical handling, safety and tolerability of Safinamide are better than of 
      dopamine agonists or levodopa. Safinamide supplements the existing armamentarium of 
      drugs for Parkinson's disease. Safinamide will help to reduce dosing of levodopa but 
      also of dopamine agonists during long term treatment in patients with Parkinson's 
      disease.

TI  - Dementia with Lewy bodies.
PG  - 182-8
LID - 10.1055/s-0034-1381741 [doi]
AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common diagnosis of dementia 
      after Alzheimer disease (AD). The essential pathologic feature is the Lewy body, a 
      neuronal inclusion containing α-synuclein, found in brainstem nuclei and the 
      neocortex. Clinical features include early fluctuations in attention, 
      hallucinations, and parkinsonism, with progression to a combined cortical and 
      subcortical dementia. To distinguish it from Parkinson disease dementia, a time 
      course of one year from cognitive changes to motor feature onset has been 
      established. There is more severe impairment of verbal fluency, executive function, 
      and visuospatial abilities in DLB patients. Both rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
      disorder and neuroleptic sensitivity are notable in this patient group. Treatment is 
      aimed at symptom management. Cholinesterase inhibitors can be beneficial for 
      behavioral and cognitive issues, whereas dopaminergic agents may help motor 
      symptoms. Survival is equivalent to AD when measured from symptom onset, though 
      diagnosis in DLB may be delayed.

      application.
PG  - 414-425

AB  - Tyrosinase is an important enzyme in controlling the formation of melanin in 
      melanosome, and plays a key role in the pigmentation of hair and skin. The abnormal 
      expression or activation of tyrosinase is associated with several diseases such as 
      albinism, vitiligo, melanoma and Parkinson disease. Excessive deposition of melanin 
      could cause diseases such as freckles and brown spots in the human body, and it is 
      also closely related to browning of fruits and vegetables and insect molting. 
      Detecting and inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase is of extraordinary value in the 
      progress of diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Therefore, many selective 
      optical detection probes and small molecular inhibitors have been developed, and 
      have made significant contributions to the basic and clinical research on these 
      diseases. In this paper, the detection and inhibition of tyrosinase and their 
      application in whitening products are reviewed, with special emphasis on development 
      of fluorescent probes and inhibitors. Hopefully, this review will help design more 
      efficient and sensitive tyrosinase probes and inhibitors, as well as shed light on 
      novel treatment of diseases such as melanoma.

AB  - F(1)F(O) ATP synthase is responsible for the production of >95% of all ATP synthesis 
      within the cell. Dysregulation of its expression, activity or localization is linked 
      to various human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's and 
      Parkinson's disease. In addition, ATP synthase is a novel and viable drug target for 
      the development of antimicrobials as evidenced by bedaquiline, which was approved in 
      2012 for the treatment of tuberculosis. Historically, natural products have been a 
      rich source of ATP synthase inhibitors that help unravel the role of F(1)F(O) ATP 
      synthase in cellular bioenergetics. During the last decade, new modulators of ATP 
      synthase have been discovered through the isolation of novel natural products as 
      well as through a ligand-based drug design process. In addition, new data has been 
      obtained with regards to the structure and function of ATP synthase under 
      physiological and pathological conditions. Crystal structure studies have provided a 
      significant insight into the rotary function of the enzyme and may provide 
      additional opportunities to design a new generation of inhibitors. This review 
      provides an update on recently discovered ATP synthase modulators as well as an 
      update on existing scaffolds.

TI  - [Initial treatment of Parkinson's disease].
PG  - S163-9
AB  - The initial treatment of Parkinson's disease should be addressed to improve 
      symptoms, slow down the progression of the illness and avoid long and short term 
      complications. Drugs currently available for symptomatic treatment are levodopa, 
      dopaminergic agonists, anticholinergics and amantadine. Levodopa is still the 
      goldstandard. Both the standard preparations of carbidopa/levodopa or 
      benserazide/levodopa and the slow release preparations are suitable for initial 
      treatment. However, when to start levodopa remains controversial. Dopaminergic 
      agonists are useful symptomatic drugs. They can be used in monotherapy, but usually 
      require the addition of levodopa to obtain a satisfactory long term therapeutic 
      response. Used as adjuvant treatment to levodopa, they help lowering the dosage of 
      levodopa. Anticholinergic drugs effectively improve symptoms such as tremor and 
      rigidity but their use is limited by their side effects, particularly in older 
      people. Amantadine may be a useful drug for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease 
      when symptoms are not severe. Symptomatic treatment should be considered 
      individually in each patient. If there is only slight disability, treatment may be 
      started with amantadine alone or with a dopaminergic agonist. If there is greater 
      disability, levodopa or the simultaneous use of levodopa and a dopaminergic agonist 
      should be considered. Anticholinergic drugs should be reserved for young patients 
      with tremor as the main symptom. The newer dopamine agonists and inhibitors of 
      catachol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) are coming therapeutic options. Selegiline, a 
      MAOB inhibitor with a possible neuroprotective effect, should also be considered as 
      initial option for Parkinson's disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: After a patient is diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD), there 
      are many therapeutic options available. This article provides examples of 
      prototypical patients encountered in clinical practice and illustrates the various 
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options for the motor symptoms of PD. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Levodopa became available in the late 1960s and remains the gold 
      standard for the treatment of PD even today. Since that time, amantadine, monoamine 
      oxidase type B inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and catechol-O-methyltransferase 
      inhibitors have emerged as monotherapy, add-on therapies, or both, in the 
      armamentarium against PD. The most appropriate time to start such drugs remains a 
      clinical decision according to patient symptoms. However, earlier use of levodopa is 
      the more common practice due to its superior benefit and the side effects of 
      dopamine agonists. Deep brain stimulation continues to be the most effective 
      treatment for motor symptoms in appropriate patients, and advances in technology may 
      improve efficacy. New ways to deliver levodopa have emerged (effective 
      extended-release oral preparations and levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel), and these 
      medications provide additional options for certain patients. Exercise and 
      neurorehabilitation are increasingly recognized as important tools to combat the 
      motor symptoms of PD. Nondopaminergic drugs may help non-levodopa-responsive motor 
      symptoms. SUMMARY: Treatment of PD is multifaceted and requires a tailored 
      pharmacotherapeutic and nonpharmacologic approach for a given patient. Patients 
      should be at the center of care, and clinicians should try to provide optimum 
      benefit through the many treatment options available.

AB  - Patients with Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) have deficits resulting mainly from 
      frontostriatal dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of 
      reality orientation therapy (ROT) combined with drug therapy (acetylcholinesterase 
      inhibitors) in PDD treatment and compare it with that of drug therapy alone. 
      Patients (n = 12) with a diagnosis of PDD were divided into 2 groups: group A-drug 
      therapy and ROT; group B-drug therapy alone. Reality orientation therapy was applied 
      weekly for 6 months, and patients were assessed during the same period. Significant 
      improvements in frontostriatal deficits were observed in the group that received the 
      combined therapy, as shown mainly by the scores in verbal fluency in the Consortium 
      to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) battery ( P = .02) and in 
      attention in Scales for outcomes of Parkinson's Disease-Cognition ( P = .021) and 
      Clock Drawing Test ( P = .037). Patients who received only medication had worse 
      results in constructional praxis recall in the CERAD battery ( P = .037). Our 
      results indicate that ROT may help in the treatment of frontostriatal cognitive 
      deficits and can potentially be used to complement drug therapy.

TI  - Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: A revised (third) consensus statement 
      from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.
PG  - 147-168
LID - 10.1177/0269881116680924 [doi]
AB  - The British Association for Psychopharmacology coordinated a meeting of experts to 
      review and revise its previous 2011 guidelines for clinical practice with 
      anti-dementia drugs. As before, levels of evidence were rated using accepted 
      standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A-D, with A 
      having the strongest evidence base (from randomised controlled trials) and D the 
      weakest (case studies or expert opinion). Current clinical diagnostic criteria for 
      dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and both 
      structural (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and functional 
      (positron emission tomography and single photon emission computerised tomography) 
      brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy in particular situations (B). 
      Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective 
      for cognition in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (A), memantine for moderate to 
      severe Alzheimer's disease (A) and combination therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors 
      and memantine) may be beneficial (B). Drugs should not be stopped just because 
      dementia severity increases (A). Until further evidence is available other drugs, 
      including statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E, nutritional supplements and 
      Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment or prevention of 
      Alzheimer's disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are 
      effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are 
      not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), though 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not cognitive) 
      features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment of people 
      with Lewy body dementias (both Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy 
      bodies), and memantine may be helpful (A). No drugs are clearly effective in 
      vascular dementia, though cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial in mixed dementia 
      (B). Early evidence suggests multifactorial interventions may have potential to 
      prevent or delay the onset of dementia (B). Though the consensus statement focuses 
      on medication, psychological interventions can be effective in addition to 
      pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel 
      pharmacological approaches involving strategies to reduce amyloid and/or tau 
      deposition in those with or at high risk of Alzheimer's disease are in progress. 
      Though results of pivotal studies in early (prodromal/mild) Alzheimer's disease are 
      awaited, results to date in more established (mild to moderate) Alzheimer's disease 
      have been equivocal and no disease modifying agents are either licensed or can be 
      currently recommended for clinical use.

      Pharmacotherapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic neurological diseases are a major cause of mortality and 
      morbidity in the world. With increasing life expectancy in the developing world, the 
      incidence and prevalence of these diseases are predicted to rise even further. This 
      has also contributed to an increase in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 
      noncommunicable diseases. Treatment for such diseases also poses a challenge with 
      multiple genetic and epigenetic factors leading to a varied outcome. Personalization 
      of treatment is one way that treatment outcome/prognosis of disease can be improved, 
      and pharmacogenomics plays a significant role in this context. METHODOLOGY: This 
      article reviewed the evidence pertaining to the association of genetic and 
      epigenetic markers with major neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), which are a major source of 
      burden among neurological disorders. Types of studies included are peer-reviewed 
      original research articles from the PubMed database (1999-2018). RESULTS: This study 
      compiled data regarding specific genetic and epigenetic markers with a significant 
      correlation between the clinical diagnosis of the disease and prognosis of therapy 
      from 65 studies. In a single platform, this review highlights the clues to some 
      vital questions, such as why interferon beta (IFN-β) therapy fails to improve 
      symptoms in all MS patients? why cholinesterase inhibitors fail to improve cognitive 
      impairment in a subset of people suffering from AD? or why some individuals on 
      levodopa (L-DOPA) for PD suffer from side-effects ranging from dyskinesia to 
      hallucination while others do not? CONCLUSION: This article summarizes the genetic 
      and epigenetic factors that may either require monitoring or help in deciding future 
      pharmacotherapy in a patient suffering from MS, AD, and PD. As the health care 
      system develops and reaches newer heights, we expect more and more of these 
      biomarkers to be used as pharmacotherapeutic outcome indicators.

AB  - The impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its pharmacologic treatment on 
      health-related quality of life (HRQL) and economic outcomes is reviewed. PD is a 
      chronic and progressive neurologic disorder characterized by specific motor deficits 
      resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The 
      cardinal symptoms are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and loss of postural reflexes. 
      PD markedly reduces HRQL and places an economic burden on society of up to $25 
      billion per year. Patients' inability to move freely and to perform everyday tasks 
      restricts their independence and leads to increased reliance on caregivers and 
      assistive devices. Emotional and psychosocial well-being is also negatively 
      affected. As the disease progresses, the response to levodopa typically decreases 
      and various motor complications develop; these are difficult to treat and result in 
      further declines in HRQL. The economic costs of PD include both direct health care 
      costs (for drugs, physician services, and hospitalization) and indirect costs (for 
      lost worker productivity). Economic analyses of PD and its treatments can help guide 
      effective allocation of health care resources. Various antiparkinsonian agents and 
      formulations, such as extended-release levodopa-carbidopa and pramipexole, have been 
      found to be cost-effective relative to other agents. The newest antiparkinsonian 
      drugs, cathechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, also have the potential to improve 
      HRQL and economic outcomes, although more study is needed to confirm this. The total 
      impact of PD and its treatment can be fully appreciated only when HRQL and economic 
      outcomes, in addition to clinical outcomes, are examined.

AB  - Background Due to the limited number of MAO inhibitors in the clinics, several 
      research efforts are aimed at the discovery of novel MAO inhibitors. At present, a 
      high specificity and a reversible mode of inhibition of MAO-A/B are cited as 
      desirable traits in drug discovery process. This will help to reduce the probability 
      of causing target disruption and may increase the duration of action of drug. AIM: 
      Most of the existing MAO inhibitors lead to side effects due to the lack of affinity 
      and selectivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design novel, potent, 
      reversible and selective inhibitors for MAO-A/B. Selective inhibition of MAO-A 
      results in the elevated level of serotonin and noradrenaline. Hence, MAO-A 
      inhibitors can be used for improving the symptoms of depression. The selective MAO-B 
      inhibitors are used with L-DOPA and/or dopamine agonists in the symptomatic 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease. The present study was aimed to describe the 
      recently developed hits of MAO inhibitors. METHOD: At present, CADD techniques are 
      gaining an attention in rationale drug discovery of MAO inhibitors, and several 
      research groups employed CADD approaches on various chemical scaffolds to identify 
      novel MAO inhibitors. These computational techniques assisted in the development of 
      lead molecules with improved pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetic properties toward 
      MAOs. Further, CADD techniques provided a better understanding of structural aspects 
      of molecular targets and lead molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The present review describes 
      the importance of structural features of potential chemical scaffolds as well as the 
      role of computational approaches like ligand docking, molecular dynamics, QSAR and 
      pharmacophore modeling in the development of novel MAO inhibitors.

AB  - In recent years, a precision medicine approach, which customizes medical treatments 
      based on patients' individual profiles and incorporates variability in genes, the 
      environment, and lifestyle, has transformed medical care in numerous medical fields, 
      most notably oncology. Applying a similar approach to Parkinson's disease (PD) may 
      promote the development of disease-modifying agents that could help slow progression 
      or possibly even avert disease development in a subset of at-risk individuals. The 
      urgent need for such trials partially stems from the negative results of clinical 
      trials where interventions treat all PD patients as a single homogenous group. Here, 
      we review the current obstacles towards the development of precision interventions 
      in PD. We also review and discuss the clinical trials that target genetic forms of 
      PD, i.e., GBA-associated and LRRK2-associated PD.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a neurotransmitter that mediates the activation and inhibition 
      of inflammatory cascades. Even though physiological NO is required for defense 
      against various pathogens, excessive NO can trigger inflammatory signaling and cell 
      death through reactive nitrogen species-induced oxidative stress. Excessive NO 
      production by activated microglial cells is specifically associated with 
      neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's and 
      Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ischemia, hypoxia, multiple 
      sclerosis, and other afflictions of the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, 
      controlling excessive NO production is a desirable therapeutic strategy for managing 
      various neuroinflammatory disorders. Recently, phytochemicals have attracted 
      considerable attention because of their potential to counteract excessive NO 
      production in CNS disorders. Moreover, phytochemicals and nutraceuticals are 
      typically safe and effective. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of NO 
      production and its involvement in various neurological disorders, and we revisit a 
      number of recently identified phytochemicals which may act as NO inhibitors. This 
      review may help identify novel potent anti-inflammatory agents that can downregulate 
      NO, specifically during neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a major nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      However, few treatments exist for PD depression. Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors 
      (MAOB-Is) provide symptomatic relief for the motor symptoms of PD and exert 
      antidepressive effects. The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) investigated the effects of MAOB-Is on depressive symptoms in patients with 
      PD. METHODS: Articles on PD-management-related RCTs using one of three MAOB-Is 
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, that is, selegiline, rasagiline, 
      and safinamide, were identified. The primary outcomes were the benefits of MAOB-Is 
      for depressive symptoms. Subgroup analysis included the effects of MAOB-Is on 
      patients in the early versus middle-to-late stages of PD and the effect of 
      short-term versus long-term treatment. RESULTS: Overall, six studies were included, 
      four of which were conducted on patients with early stage PD. Overall, MAOB-Is 
      significantly reduced the severity of depressive symptoms [standardized mean 
      difference (SMD): -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.21 to -0.06, p < 0.001]. 
      Subgroup analysis indicated that the positive effect of MAOB-Is was significant in 
      patients with early stage PD (SMD: -0.20, 95% CI: -0.31 to -0.09, p < 0.001), but 
      not in those with middle-to-late-stage PD (SMD: -0.07, 95% CI: -0.17 to 0.03, 
      p = 0.18). The antidepressive effect was significant for short-term treatment, that 
      is, 90-120 days (SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.10, p < 0.001), but not long-term 
      treatment, that is, 24 weeks to 18 months (SMD: -0.08, 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.01, 
      p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: In addition to the treatment of PD motor symptoms, MAOB-Is 
      may help reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in PD, especially in patients 
      with early stage PD. Considering the tolerability and simultaneous benefits of 
      MAOB-Is, further RCTs are warranted to confirm their therapeutic effects in 
      moderate-to-severe PD depression.

LID - 10.1517/13543776.2014.907275 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a large (2527 residues) 
      complex multi-domain protein that has GTPase and kinase domains. Autosomal dominant 
      missense mutations in LRRK2 have been found in individuals with Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) and are considered responsible for 1% of all cases of PD. Among the mutations 
      confirmed to contribute to PD pathogenicity, G2019S is the most common cause of PD 
      and it increases the kinase activity of LRRK2 by around threefold. LRRK2 has 
      received considerable attention as a therapeutic target for PD, and LRRK2 inhibitors 
      may help prevent and/or treat the disease. AREAS COVERED: LRRK2 inhibitors are being 
      investigated by various industrial and academic institutions. The present review 
      covers patents literature on small-molecule LRRK2 inhibitors patented between 2011 
      and 2013. EXPERT OPINION: Currently, wild-type and mutant LRRK2 are being examined 
      as therapeutic targets for PD. In testimony to the significance of these novel 
      targets, over 20 patent applications related to LRRK2 have been filed in the last 3 
      years. Several distinct chemotypes have been reported to be LRRK2 inhibitors with 
      very good potency. These compounds are being used to elucidate the physiological and 
      pathophysiological functions of LRRK2, and some may even emerge as therapeutics for 
      PD.

TI  - Targeting α-synuclein aggregation and its role in mitochondrial dysfunction in 
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 23-45
LID - 10.1111/bph.15684 [doi]
AB  - Lewy bodies that contain aggregated α-synuclein in dopamine neurons are the main 
      culprit for neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. However, mitochondrial 
      dysfunction has a well-established and prominent role in the pathogenesis of 
      Parkinson's disease. The exact mechanism by which α-synuclein causes dopamine 
      neuronal loss is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that aggregated α-synuclein 
      localises in the mitochondria contributes to oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in 
      neurons. Therefore, the involvement of aggregated α-synuclein in mitochondrial 
      dysfunction-mediated neuronal loss has made it an emerging drug target for the 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the exact mechanism by which α-synuclein 
      permeabilises through the mitochondrial membrane and affects the electron transport 
      chain remains under investigation. In the present study, we describe 
      mitochondria-α-synuclein interactions and how α-synuclein aggregation modulates 
      mitochondrial homeostasis in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. We also discuss 
      recent therapeutic interventions targeting α-synuclein aggregation that may help 
      researchers to design novel therapeutic treatments for Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Brain illness and creativity: mechanisms and treatment risks.
PG  - 132-43
AB  - Brain diseases and their treatment may help or hurt creativity in ways that shape 
      quality of life. Increased creative drive is associated with bipolar disorder, 
      depression, psychosis, temporal lobe epilepsy, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson 
      disease treatments, and autism. Creativity depends on goal-driven approach 
      motivation from midbrain dopaminergic systems. Fear-driven avoidance motivation is 
      of less aid to creativity. When serotonin and norepinephrine lower motivation and 
      flexible behaviour, they can inhibit creativity. Hemispheric lateralization and 
      frontotemporal connections must interact to create new ideas and conceptual schemes. 
      The right brain and temporal lobe contribute skill in novelty detection, while the 
      left brain and frontal lobe foster approach motivation and more easily generate new 
      patterns of action from the novel perceptions. Genes and phenotypes that increase 
      plasticity and creativity in tolerant environments with relaxed selection pressure 
      may confer risk in rigorous environments. Few papers substantively address this 
      important but fraught topic. Antidepressants (ADs) that inhibit fear-driven 
      motivation, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sometimes inhibit 
      goal-oriented motivation as well. ADs that boost goal-directed motivation, such as 
      bupropion, may remediate this effect. Benzodiazepines and alcohol may be 
      counterproductive. Although dopaminergic agonists sometimes stimulate creativity, 
      their doing so may inappropriately disinhibit behaviour. Dopamine antagonists may 
      suppress creative motivation; lithium and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers may do so 
      less. Physical exercise and REM sleep may help creativity. Art therapy and 
      psychotherapy are not well studied. Preserving creative motivation can help 
      creativity and other aspects of well-being in all patients, not just artists or 
      researchers.

TI  - Pharmacological and clinical implications of MAO-B inhibitors.
PG  - 1527-39
AB  - Although the involvement of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) in physiological function is 
      not yet well understood, its inhibitors have been shown to be quite useful in the 
      treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Platelet MAO-B activity has been 
      found to be reduced in several psychiatric disorders, related to substance abuse and 
      associated with different personalities. 1-Deprenyl (selegiline), an archetypical 
      MAO-B inhibitor, alone does not seem to exert an antidepressive effect, however, it 
      may become useful when administered in combination with amine neurotransmitter 
      precursors. MAO-B inhibitors are useful adjunct drugs to 1-DOPA in the symptomatic 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease. Interestingly, 1-deprenyl alone can slow down the 
      progress of otherwise disabled syndromes of Parkinson's disease. It has been 
      proposed that 1-deprenyl may play a role in neuroprotection and neurorescue. MAO-B 
      inhibitors can selectively and dramatically increase the level of 
      beta-phenylethylamine, which has been shown to potentiate dopamine and noradrenaline 
      function in the central nervous system. Several new types of highly selective, 
      reversible and irreversible MAO-B inhibitors have recently been developed. The 
      mechanism(s) of neuroprotective and rescue actions of 1-deprenyl and other MAO-B 
      inhibitors will help to shed some light on our understanding of the 
      neurodegenerative process.

TI  - A Stage-Based Approach to Therapy in Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/biom9080388 [doi]
LID - 388
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that features progressive, 
      disabling motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor. 
      Nevertheless, some non-motor symptoms, including depression, REM sleep behavior 
      disorder, and olfactive impairment, are even earlier features of PD. At later 
      stages, apathy, impulse control disorder, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and 
      cognitive impairment can present, and they often become a heavy burden for both 
      patients and caregivers. Indeed, PD increasingly compromises activities of daily 
      life, even though a high variability in clinical presentation can be observed among 
      people affected. Nowadays, symptomatic drugs and non-pharmaceutical treatments 
      represent the best therapeutic options to improve quality of life in PD patients. 
      The aim of the present review is to provide a practical, stage-based guide to 
      pharmacological management of both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, 
      warning about drug side effects, contraindications, as well as dosage and methods of 
      administration, are highlighted here, to help the physician in yielding the best 
      therapeutic strategies for each symptom and condition in patients with PD.

AB  - Fluctuations (wearing-off, on off phenomenon, dyskinesias) are a big challenge in 
      the long term treatment of parkinsonian patients. We describe the current strategies 
      for prevention and treatment of fluctuations. Special emphasis is put on two new 
      methods which will soon be available. The new dopamine agonist Rotigotine (Neupro) 
      can be transdermally applied. This is a rather simple way to achieve a continuous 
      dopaminergic stimulation. The same goal is achieved by direct application of 
      levodopa-/carbidopa-gelsuspension (Duodopa) in the duodenum by the help of an 
      electronic pump.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease and its characteristic is 
      the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra 
      (SN) of the midbrain. There is hardly any clinically proven efficient therapeutics 
      for its cure in several recent preclinical advances proposed to treat PD. Recent 
      studies have found that the endocannabinoid signaling system in particular the 
      comprised two receptors, CB1 and CB2 receptors, has a significant regulatory 
      function in basal ganglia and is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, 
      adding new insights into the biochemical interactions between cannabinoids and other 
      signaling pathways may help develop new pharmacological strategies. Factors of the 
      endocannabinoid system (ECS) are abundantly expressed in the neural circuits of 
      basal ganglia, where they interact interactively with glutamatergic, γ-aminobutyric 
      acid-ergic (GABAergic), and dopaminergic signaling systems. Although preclinical 
      studies on PD are promising, the use of cannabinoids at the clinical level has not 
      been thoroughly studied. In this review, we evaluated the available evidence and 
      reviewed the involvement of ECS in etiologies, symptoms and treatments related to 
      PD. Since CB1 and CB2 receptors are the two main receptors of endocannabinoids, we 
      primarily put the focus on the therapeutic role of CB1 and CB2 receptors in PD. We 
      will try to determine future research clues that will help understand the potential 
      therapeutic benefits of the ECS in the treatment of PD, aiming to open up new 
      strategies and ideas for the treatment of PD.

PG  - 380-7

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with 
      an estimated 4 million patients worldwide. L-dopa is standard, and often initial, 
      therapy for patients with this condition; however, with continued dopaminergic 
      treatment and as the disease progresses, the majority of patients experience 
      complications such as "wearing-off" symptoms, dyskinesias, and other motor 
      complications. These complications may become disabling and profoundly affect 
      quality of life. Treatment modification and combination therapies with L-dopa, 
      dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, and 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors are commonly used to manage complications. 
      In recent years regulatory agencies, clinical researchers, and sponsors have widely 
      accepted and utilized changes in "ON" and "OFF" time measured by Patient Hauser 
      Diaries as endpoints for measuring efficacy of therapeutics seeking approval for 
      symptomatic treatment of PD. Successful antiparkinsonian medications have been 
      associated with treatment effects of more than 1 h in either reduction of "OFF" time 
      of increase in "ON" time. Accurate "ON" and "OFF" time registration during clinical 
      studies requires rigorous patient training. Reduced compliance, recall bias and 
      diary fatigue are common problems seen with patient diary reported measures. 
      Electronic diaries may help reducing some of these problems but may be associated 
      with other challenges in large, multicenter studies.

      incidence, neurobiological basis, management and prevention.
PG  - 475-88

AB  - Treatment of Parkinson's disease has traditionally focused on the management of 
      motor disability while behavioural disturbances have received less attention. 
      Recently, impulse control disorders and aberrant repetitive behaviours have surged 
      to clinical relevance as they occur during dopamine replacement treatment (mainly 
      with dopamine agonists) and worsen patient and caregiver quality of life. Patients 
      are unable to adequately estimate the negative consequences of their actions and are 
      prone to entertain compulsive reward-seeking activities. This review aims to 
      summarize current evidence on the epidemiology of behavioural disturbances in 
      Parkinson's disease, recent insights into their neurobiological basis and to discuss 
      strategies for management and prevention. Studies from 1990 through to December 2008 
      were retrieved via searches of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and 
      PubMed. The mechanisms underlying the development of behavioural disturbances in 
      Parkinson's disease are debated but current evidence points to specific risk 
      factors: male sex, young age at onset, underlying personality traits characterized 
      by high impulsivity and novelty seeking, and personal or family history of addictive 
      disorders. Specifically, in predisposed individuals dopamine replacement therapy 
      leads to overstimulation of dopamine receptors within the mesocorticolimbic pathways 
      and in turn to the development of addictive behaviours, such as impulse control 
      disorders and compulsive medication intake. Since these disturbances affect 
      individuals who have often unremarkable psychiatric history and no cognitive 
      impairment, their identification and management is complex. Compulsive medication 
      intake (described as 'hedonistic homeostatic dysregulation' or 'dopamine 
      dysregulation syndrome') is commonly associated with fluctuations in advanced 
      disease, while impulse control disorders frequently occur in early Parkinson's 
      disease and within normal-range medication dosages. Management primarily requires 
      reduction of dopaminergic therapy but psychosocial support is often required. Use of 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the dose used for obsessive compulsive 
      disorders may help, while benefit from atypical antipsychotics is limited in most 
      cases. Deep brain stimulation should be considered with caution in these subjects. 
      Prevention is based on the identification of at-risk individuals and active 
      monitoring. Given the social and potentially medical-legal consequences of these 
      behaviours, we encourage treating physicians to discuss risks with patients before 
      treatment is initiated.

AB  - The GTP-binding protein, Rho, plays a significant role in the cellular pathology of 
      Parkinson's disease. The downstream effector of Rho, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), 
      performs several functions, including microglial inflammatory response and enhanced 
      Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Its inhibition shows neuroprotective effects in carried 
      studies. Parkinson's disease pathology also rests on incomplete removal of damaged 
      mitochondria, leading to neuronal impairment. ROCK has different isoforms, 
      inhibition of which have been shown to decrease the adverse changes in microglia. 
      There has also been evidence of a decreased release of inflammatory cytokines and a 
      reduction in degradation of dopaminergic neurons on the addition of ROCK inhibitors. 
      Additionally, ROCK inhibitors have recently been shown to increase the activity of 
      hexokinase 2 (HK2), relocating it to mitochondria, and therefore leading to 
      upregulated mitochondrial targeting. Understanding the cellular basis of ROCK 
      activity and its inhibition may help us advance in creating new strategies for the 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease.

      hemiparkinsonian rats: A systematic review.
PG  - 268-295
LID - 10.17179/excli2020-1024 [doi]
AB  - The alleged effects of serotonergic agents in alleviating levodopa-induced 
      dyskinesias (LIDs) in parkinsonian patients are debatable. To this end, we 
      systematically reviewed the serotonergic agents used for the treatment of LIDs in a 
      6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease in rats. We searched MEDLINE via 
      PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Proquest for entries no later than March 2018, 
      and restricted the search to publications on serotonergic agents used for the 
      treatment of LIDs in hemiparkinsonian rats. The initial search yielded 447 
      citations, of which 49 articles and one conference paper met our inclusion criteria. 
      The results revealed ten different categories of serotonergic agents, including but 
      not limited to 5-HT(1A/B)R agonists, 5-HT(2A)R antagonists, selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), 
      and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), all of which improved LIDs without imposing 
      considerable adverse effects. Although there is promising evidence regarding the 
      role of these agents in relieving LIDs in hemiparkinsonian rats, further studies are 
      needed for the enlightenment of hidden aspect of these molecules in terms of 
      mechanisms and outcomes. Given this, improving the quality of the pre-clinical 
      studies and designing appropriate clinical trials will help fill the 
      bench-to-bedside gap.

TI  - Management of visual hallucinations in dementia and Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 815-836
LID - 10.1017/S1041610218001400 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACTObjectives:Visual hallucinations are a common symptom in dementia and 
      Parkinson's disease and have been associated with greater cognitive and functional 
      decline, but optimal management strategies are unclear. We review the frequency and 
      pathogenesis of visual hallucinations in dementia and Parkinson's disease and 
      examine the evidence base for their management. DESIGN: We undertook a systematic 
      review of the visual hallucinations in dementia, searching studies published between 
      January 1980 and July 2017 using PubMed with the search terms visual hallucinations 
      AND review AND (dementia OR parkinson*). RESULTS: We found 645 articles and screened 
      them for relevance, finally including 89 papers (11 meta-analyses, 34 randomized 
      controlled trials, six other trials and a number of relevant review articles). Only 
      six of the trials reported visual hallucination outcomes separately from other 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical antipsychotics were frequently 
      studied, but with the exception of clozapine in Parkinson's disease dementia, 
      results were equivocal. There was some evidence that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
      may help visual hallucinations. Overall, effect sizes for most treatments were small 
      and there were few studies with long term follow up. Treatments need to be carefully 
      weighed up with the risks and reviewed often, and many patients improved without 
      treatment. There is a lack of data regarding visual hallucinations due to the 
      grouping of psychotic symptoms together in commonly used rating scales. The lack of 
      a specific rating scales, or analyzable items within other scales, for visual 
      hallucinations, limited efficacy of current and small evidence base with short 
      follow up are important areas for future studies to address.

AB  - Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor 
      and non-motor symptoms, is strongly associated with the death of dopaminergic 
      neurons in the brain's substantia nigra. Although dopamine replacement therapy 
      temporarily helps patients manage their motor symptoms, this current standard of 
      care fails to address the underlying network of pathologies that contribute to the 
      persistent death of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, new treatment approaches are needed 
      that address the underlying pathologies and, thereby, slow or halt the progression 
      of the actual disease. D-β-hydroxybutyrate - a ketone body produced by the liver to 
      support brain function during periods of starvation - may provide an option. 
      Lifestyle interventions that induce endogenous D-β-hydroxybutyrate production, such 
      as caloric restriction and ketogenic diets, are known to increase healthspan and 
      lifespan in animal models and are used to treat neurological disorders. The efficacy 
      of these ketosis-inducing interventions, along with the recent development of 
      commercially available D-β-hydroxybutyrate-based nutritional supplements, should 
      inspire interest in the possibility that D-β-hydroxybutyrate itself exerts 
      neuroprotective effects. This review provides a molecular model to justify the 
      further exploration of such a possibility. Herein, we explore the cellular 
      mechanisms by which the ketone body, D-β-hydroxybutyrate, acting both as a 
      metabolite and as a signaling molecule, could help to prevent the development, or 
      slow the progression of, Parkinson's disease. Specifically, the metabolism of 
      D-β-hydroxybutyrate may help neurons replenish their depleted ATP stores and protect 
      neurons against oxidative damage. As a G-protein-coupled receptor ligand and histone 
      deacetylase inhibitor, D-β-hydroxybutyrate may further protect neurons against 
      energy deficit and oxidative stress, while also decreasing damaging 
      neuroinflammation and death by apoptosis. Restricted to the available evidence, our 
      model relies largely upon the interpretation of data from the separate literatures 
      on the cellular effects of D-β-hydroxybutyrate and on the pathogenesis of 
      Parkinson's disease. Future studies are needed to reveal whether D-β-hydroxybutyrate 
      actually has the potential to serve as an adjunctive nutritional therapy for 
      Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Chemical compounds that interfere with an enzymatic function of kinases are useful 
      for gaining insight into the complicated biochemical processes in mammalian cells. 
      Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) play an essential role in the control of the cell 
      cycle and/or proliferation. These kinases as well as their regulators are frequently 
      deregulated in different human tumors. Aberrations in CDK activity have also been 
      observed in viral infections, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, ischemia and some 
      proliferative disorders. This led to an intensive search for small-molecule CDK 
      inhibitors not only for research purposes, but also for therapeutic applications. 
      Here, we discuss seventeen CDK inhibitors and their use in cancer research or 
      therapy. This review should help researchers to decide which inhibitor is best 
      suited for the specific purpose of their research. For this purpose, the targets, 
      commercial availability and IC(50) values are provided for each inhibitor. The 
      review will also provide an overview of the clinical studies performed with some of 
      these inhibitors.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, 
      pose an increasingly severe burden for individuals and society in an ageing 
      population. The causes and mechanisms of the diseases are poorly understood and as 
      yet there are no effective treatments. Some of the molecular complexes involved in 
      degeneration have been identified and electron microscopy has provided an essential 
      tool in the investigations. The focus of this review is to show how electron 
      microscopy has contributed historically to the understanding of disease and to 
      summarize the most striking current advances. It does not seek to cover in detail 
      the recent technical developments in microscopy, involving better microscopes, 
      better electron detectors and more powerful image processing techniques, which have 
      made possible the new insights. In many instances pathological filament assemblies 
      are associated with brain cells that die in the disease, causing the observed 
      symptoms such as dementia or movement disorders. Using electron microscopy it is now 
      possible to go beyond morphological descriptions to produce atomic structures of 
      many of the filaments. This information may help to understand the seeding and 
      assembly of the filaments, with the aim of finding small molecule inhibitors that 
      could potentially provide a form of treatment for the diseases.

TI  - [Stage-adjusted treatment of idiopathic Parkinson syndrome].
PG  - 294-8
AB  - The treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease has been divided in 3 different 
      phases. In the first phase the patient's disability is still minimal and a treatment 
      with selegiline (possibly combined with an anticholinergic drug) is sufficient. In 
      the second phase the treatment with levodopa (plus an decarboxylase inhibitor) 
      becomes indispensable. In order to minimize the problems of long-term therapy a 
      dopaminergic agonist (mostly bromocriptine) is added. The third phase is 
      characterized by these problems. Some measures are discussed which may help to 
      increase the patients' quality of life.

TI  - Parkinson's disease. Diagnosis and the initiation of therapy.
PG  - 145-54
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is 
      characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and gait impairment. There 
      is no specific diagnostic test for PD and it is important for clinicians to 
      understand the clinical signs which help to distinguish PD from parkinsonism. It is 
      equally important to be aware of the clinical signs which can be an indication that 
      the diagnosis is not PD. These so-called Parkinson-plus syndromes include 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), corticobasal 
      degeneration (CBD), vascular parkinsonism (VP) and parkinsonism with dementia (Lewy 
      body dementia, LBD). The differential diagnosis of parkinsonism will be discussed. 
      Initiating pharmacologic therapy for PD must take into consideration the degree of 
      dysfunction the patient is experiencing, the question of neuroprotection, the degree 
      of motor response required, and the potential complications of long-term treatment. 
      Neuropro-tective trials of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), vitamin C, vitamin E, monoamine 
      oxidase B inhibitors (MAO-I) and dopamine agonists do not support the use of any of 
      these drugs for a neuroprotective effect. There is recent supportive evidence that 
      levodopa may have a neuroprotective effect. Either dopamine agonists or levodopa may 
      be initiated. Dopamine agonists are associated with fewer motor fluctuations and 
      dyskinesias, while levodopa is associated with better motor performance. Initiation 
      of therapy should be tailored to individual patients with the emphasis on symptom 
      control, with the hope that new approaches to treatment of PD (including 
      neuroprotection) will be forthcoming.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the 
      central nervous system for which currently there is no cure. Its treatment requires 
      long-term, interdisciplinary disease management, and usage of typical medications, 
      including levodopa, dopamine agonists, and enzymes, such as MAO-B inhibitors. The 
      key goal of disease management is to prolong patients' independence and keep their 
      quality of life. Due to the different combinations of motor and non-motor symptoms 
      from which PD patients suffer, in addition to existing comorbidities, the change of 
      medications and their combinations is difficult and patient-specific. To help 
      physicians, we developed two decision support models for PD management, which 
      suggest how to change the medication treatment. METHODS: The models were developed 
      using DEX methodology, which integrates the qualitative multi-criteria decision 
      modelling with rule-based expert systems. The two DEX models differ in the way the 
      decision rules were defined. In the first model, the decision rules are based on the 
      interviews with neurologists (DEX expert model), and in the second model, they are 
      formed from a database of past medication change decisions (DEX data model). We 
      assessed both models on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and on 
      a questionnaire answered by 17 neurologists from 4 European countries using accuracy 
      measure and the Jaccard index. RESULTS: Both models include 15 sub-models that 
      address possible medication treatment changes based on the given patients' current 
      state. In particular, the models incorporate current state changes in patients' 
      motor symptoms (dyskinesia intensity, dyskinesia duration, OFF duration), mental 
      problems (impulsivity, cognition, hallucinations and paranoia), epidemiologic data 
      (patient's age, activity level) and comorbidities (cardiovascular problems, 
      hypertension and low blood pressure). The highest accuracy of the developed 
      sub-models for 15 medication treatment changes ranges from 69.31 to 99.06 %. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results show that the DEX expert model is superior to the DEX data 
      model. The results indicate that the constructed models are sufficiently adequate 
      and thus fit for the purpose of making "second-opinion" suggestions to decision 
      support users.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder without effective 
      disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, we establish a chemogenetic dopamine (DA) 
      neuron ablation model in larval zebrafish with mitochondrial dysfunction and 
      robustness suitable for high-content screening. We use this system to conduct an in 
      vivo DA neuron imaging-based chemical screen and identify the 
      Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors as significantly 
      neuroprotective. Knockdown of the angiotensin receptor 1 (agtr1) in DA neurons 
      reveals a cell-autonomous mechanism of neuroprotection. DA neuron-specific RNA-seq 
      identifies mitochondrial pathway gene expression that is significantly restored by 
      RAAS inhibitor treatment. The neuroprotective effect of RAAS inhibitors is further 
      observed in a zebrafish Gaucher disease model and Drosophila pink1-deficient PD 
      model. Finally, examination of clinical data reveals a significant effect of RAAS 
      inhibitors in delaying PD progression. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential 
      and mechanisms of targeting the RAAS pathway for neuroprotection and demonstrate a 
      salient approach that bridges basic science to translational medicine.

OAB - Parkinson’s disease is caused by the slow death and deterioration of brain cells, in 
      particular of the neurons that produce a chemical messenger known as dopamine. 
      Certain drugs can mitigate the resulting drop in dopamine levels and help to manage 
      symptoms, but they cause dangerous side-effects. There is no treatment that can slow 
      down or halt the progress of the condition, which affects 0.3% of the population 
      globally. Many factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the emergence 
      of Parkinson’s disease. For example, dysfunction of the mitochondria, the internal 
      structures that power up cells, is a known mechanism associated with the death of 
      dopamine-producing neurons. Zebrafish are tiny fish which can be used to study 
      Parkinson’s disease, as they are easy to manipulate in the lab and share many 
      characteristics with humans. In particular, they can be helpful to test the effects 
      of various potential drugs on the condition. Here, Kim et al. established a new 
      zebrafish model in which dopamine-producing brain cells die due to their 
      mitochondria not working properly; they then used this assay to assess the impact of 
      1,403 different chemicals on the integrity of these cells. A group of molecules 
      called renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors was shown to protect 
      dopamine-producing neurons and stopped them from dying as often. These are already 
      used to treat high blood pressure as they help to dilate blood vessels. In the 
      brain, however, RAAS worked by restoring certain mitochondrial processes. Kim et al. 
      then investigated whether these results are relevant in other, broader contexts. 
      They were able to show that RAAS inhibitors have the same effect in other animals, 
      and that Parkinson’s disease often progresses more slowly in patients that already 
      take these drugs for high blood pressure. Taken together, these findings therefore 
      suggest that RAAS inhibitors may be useful to treat Parkinson’s disease, as well as 
      other brain illnesses that emerge because of mitochondria not working properly. 
      Clinical studies and new ways to improve these drugs are needed to further 
      investigate and capitalize on these potential benefits.

PG  - 93-126
AB  - This review provides an overview of the three most widely used cholinesterase (ChE) 
      inhibitors: donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Differences in pharmacologic 
      profiles will be discussed, and consideration will be given to how such differences 
      may relate to and influence the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the various 
      agents. In addition to providing cognitive benefits in patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), growing clinical evidence also suggests that ChE inhibitors can 
      produce favorable and clinically relevant effects on neuropsychiatric/behavioral 
      disturbances and activities of daily living. Furthermore, recent data indicate that 
      these agents may be effective at all levels of disease severity and for all rates of 
      disease progression. The clinical utility of ChE inhibitors in a wider spectrum of 
      dementias which share a common cholinergic deficit, such as Lewy body dementia, 
      Parkinson's disease dementia, and vascular dementia, is currently under 
      investigation. Beyond symptomatic relief, data suggest that ChE inhibitors may also 
      slow the underlying disease process. As clinical and research experience with these 
      agents continues to accumulate, the differences in their effects will become more 
      apparent and will help physicians tailor ChE inhibition treatment to the needs of 
      the individual patient.

TI  - Pre-Clinical Neuroprotective Evidences and Plausible Mechanisms of Sulforaphane in 
      Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22062929 [doi]
LID - 2929
AB  - Sulforaphane, a potent dietary bioactive agent obtainable from cruciferous 
      vegetables, has been extensively studied for its effects in disease prevention and 
      therapy. Sulforaphane potently induces transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 
      2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated expression of detoxification, anti-oxidation, and 
      immune system-modulating enzymes, and possibly acts as an anti-carcinogenic agent. 
      Several clinical trials are in progress to study the effect of diverse types of 
      cruciferous vegetables and sulforaphane on prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung 
      cancer, atopic asthmatics, skin aging, dermatitis, obesity, etc. Recently, the 
      protective effects of sulforaphane on brain health were also considerably studied, 
      where the studies have further extended to several neurological diseases, including 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. 
      Animal and cell studies that employ sulforaphane against memory impairment and 
      AD-related pre-clinical biomarkers on amyloid-β, tau, inflammation, oxidative 
      stress, and neurodegeneration are summarized, and plausible neuroprotective 
      mechanisms of sulforaphane to help prevent AD are discussed. The increase in 
      pre-clinical evidences consistently suggests that sulforaphane has a multi-faceted 
      neuroprotective effect on AD pathophysiology. The anti-AD-like evidence of 
      sulforaphane seen in cells and animals indicates the need to pursue sulforaphane 
      research for relevant biomarkers in AD pre-symptomatic populations.

AB  - Pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is undoubtedly a multifactorial phenomenon, 
      with diverse etiological agents. Pro-inflammatory mediators act as a skew that 
      directs disease progression during neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the 
      dynamics of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in preventing or reducing 
      disease progression has recently gained much attention. Inflammatory 
      neuro-degeneration is regulated via cytokines, chemokines, lipid mediators and 
      immune cell subsets; however, individual cellular phenotypes in the Central Nervous 
      System (CNS) acts in diverse ways whose persistent activation leads to unresolving 
      inflammation often causing unfavorable outcomes in neurodegenerative disease like 
      PD. Specifically, activation of cellular phenotypes like astrocytes, microglia, 
      activation of peripheral immune cells requires different activation signals and 
      agents like (cytokines, misfolded protein aggregates, infectious agents, pesticides 
      like organophosphates, etc.,). However, what is unknown is how the different 
      cellular phenotypes respond uniquely and the role of the factors they secrete alters 
      the signal cascades in the complex neuron-microglial connections in the CNS. Hence, 
      understanding the role of cellular phenotypes and the inflammatory mediators, the 
      cross talk among the signals and their receptors can help us to identify the 
      potential therapeutic target using natural products. In this review we have tried to 
      put together the role of cellular phenotypes as a skew that favors PD progression 
      and we have also discussed how the lack of experimental approaches and challenges 
      that affects understanding the cellular targets that can be used against natural 
      derivatives in alleviating PD pathophysiology. Together, this review will provide 
      the better insights into the role of cellular phenotypes of neuroinflammation, 
      inflammatory mediators and the orchestrating factors of inflammation and how they 
      can be targeted in a more specific way that can be used in the clinical management 
      of PD.

TI  - The ABC of Alzheimer's disease: cognitive changes and their management in 
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
PG  - 51-75
AB  - Cognitive decline, commonly first recognized as memory impairment, is a typical 
      feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuropathological changes in the cerebral 
      cortex and limbic system lead to deficits in learning, memory, language, and 
      visuospatial skills. The precise nature of cognitive dysfunction reflects the 
      distribution of pathological changes in AD. These will vary along the disease 
      severity continuum and may also depend on where the disease sits in the spectrum of 
      dementia. For example, AD-related disorders such as Lewy body dementia (LBD) and 
      Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) also show symptoms of cognitive decline and share 
      several pathological features, including degeneration of cortical cholinergic and 
      striatal dopaminergic neurons. In vascular dementia (VaD), there is often an unequal 
      distribution of cognitive deficit, with severe impairment in some functions and 
      relative sparing of others. Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors, which help restore 
      acetylcholine levels in the brain, are licensed for the symptomatic treatment of AD 
      and have shown additional benefit in related dementias. Physiological correlates of 
      cholinergic function/dysfunction in the brain include regional cerebral blood flow, 
      glucose metabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid levels of ChE enzymes. These variables 
      represent valuable markers of the clinical efficacy of ChE inhibitors. However, 
      direct assessment of cognitive improvement, stabilization or decline is usually 
      considered the key efficacy parameter in clinical studies of ChE inhibitors in AD 
      and related dementias. Large-scale, placebo-controlled clinical studies of ChE 
      inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating the cognitive impairments 
      associated with AD. Randomized comparative studies of ChE inhibitors are now under 
      way to directly compare symptomatic efficacy and effects on disease progression. 
      Clinical trial data of the cognitive effects of ChE inhibitors in AD, LBD, PDD, and 
      VaD are discussed in detail in this article. The benefits of long-term treatment on 
      symptomatic improvement in cognition and further potential disease-modifying effects 
      are highlighted.

AB  - Available treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, 
      Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, do not 
      arrest disease progression but mainly help keeping patients from getting worse for a 
      limited period of time. Increasing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms such 
      as DNA methylation and histone tail modifications are dynamically regulated in 
      neurons and play a fundamental role in learning and memory processes. In addition, 
      both global and gene-specific epigenetic changes and deregulated expression of the 
      writer and eraser proteins of epigenetic marks are believed to contribute to the 
      onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Studies in animal models of 
      neurodegenerative diseases have highlighted the potential role of epigenetic drugs, 
      including inhibitors of histone deacetylases and methyl donor compounds, in 
      ameliorating the cognitive symptoms and preventing or delaying the motor symptoms of 
      the disease, thereby opening the way for a potential application in human pathology.

      Lewy body disease is the second most common cause of dementia, following Alzheimer's 
      disease. The treatment of DLB includes cholinergic therapy for cognitive impairment, 
      atypical neuroleptics to alleviate hallucinations, and levodopa/carbidopa to improve 
      parkinsonism. The recognition and diagnosis of DLB has critical treatment 
      implications. Centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitors, such as rivastigmine, 
      donepezil, and galantamine partially reverse decreased cortical cholinergic activity 
      and may improve cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB. Rivastigmine has 
      been demonstrated to improve cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients 
      with DLB without worsening parkinsonian features. Due to the potential adverse 
      events associated with neuroleptics in this population, treatment with 
      cholinesterase inhibitors is currently considered first-line therapy in the 
      treatment of hallucinations and mental status fluctuations in DLB. Exquisite 
      sensitivity to neuroleptic medications is a hallmark of DLB and life-threatening 
      complications have been reported. Caution should be exercised when implementing 
      antipsychotic therapy for the treatment of behavioral disturbances of DLB. When 
      required, atypical neuroleptics with the least extrapyramdial side effects, such as 
      quetiapine, should be used. The parkinsonian features of DLB may respond to 
      dopaminergic therapy with levodopa. If parkinsonian symptoms result in clinical 
      disability, a trial of levodopa is warranted. Unfortunately, dopaminergic 
      medications may worsen hallucinations. Because dopamine agonists have a greater 
      tendency to induce hallucinations and somnolence, levodopa is the treatment of 
      choice for parkinsonism in DLB. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder 
      (RBD) is now recognized as a feature of DLB. Awareness of the presence of this 
      symptom in patients with DLB is important and treatment with low dose clonazepam may 
      help. Cholinergic aumentation may also improve these symptoms in patients with DLB.

TI  - The cholinergic deficiency syndrome and its therapeutic implications.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - Cholinesterase inhibitors are licensed for treatment of dementia in Alzheimer's 
      disease. However, the effects of these drugs on the cognitive symptoms of dementia 
      are very small. We suggest that symptoms like impairment of attention and 
      concentration, anxiety, restlessness and hallucinations, delineate a specific 
      central cholinergic deficiency syndrome (CDS), that may be a much better target for 
      such treatment. Changes in the quantitative electroencephalogram, muscarinic subtype 
      radioimaging and serum anticholinergic activity may potentially help to diagnose the 
      CDS. CDS is suggested to occur in various neurodegenerative diseases like 
      Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease and to respond well 
      to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy.

AB  - Since its discovery, the dopamine D(4) receptor (D(4)R) has been suggested to be an 
      attractive target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. Novel findings 
      have renewed the interest in such a receptor as an emerging target for the 
      management of different diseases, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, alcohol or 
      substance use disorders, eating disorders, erectile dysfunction and cognitive 
      deficits. The recently resolved crystal structures of D(4)R in complexes with the 
      potent ligands nemonapride and L-745870 strongly improved the knowledge on the 
      molecular mechanisms involving the D(4)R functions and may help medicinal chemists 
      in drug design. This review is focused on the recent development of the subtype 
      selective D(4)R ligands belonging to classical or new chemotypes. Moreover, ligands 
      showing functional selectivity toward G protein activation or β-arrestin recruitment 
      and the effects of selective D(4)R ligands on the above-mentioned diseases are 
      discussed.

AB  - Heterocyclic compounds play a significant role in various biological processes of 
      the human body and many of them are in clinical use due to their diverse, chemical 
      and biological properties. Among these, indole is one of the most promising 
      pharmacologically active molecules. Due to its chemical reactivity, indole has been 
      willingly modified to obtain a variety of new lead molecules, which has been 
      successfully utilized to obtained novel drug candidates for the treatment of 
      different pharmacological diseases. Indole-based compounds such as vincristine 
      (anticancer), reserpine (antihypertensive), amedalin (antidepressant) and many more 
      describe the medicinal and pharmacological importance of the indole in uplifting 
      human life. In this review, we compiled various reports on indole derivatives and 
      their biological significance, including antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiplatelet, 
      anti- Alzheimer's, anti-Parkinson's, antioxidant and anticancer potential from 2015 
      onwards. In addition, structure-activity relationship studies of the different 
      derivatives have been included. We have also discussed novel synthetic strategies 
      developed during this period for the synthesis of different indole derivatives. We 
      believe that this review article will provide comprehensive knowledge about the 
      medicinal importance of indoles and will help in the design and synthesis of novel 
      indole-based molecules with high potency and efficacy.

TI  - Recent advances in the development of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) inhibitors.
PG  - 119-27
LID - 10.1007/s00726-011-1188-4 [doi]
AB  - Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a Ca(2+)-dependent enzyme and probably the most 
      ubiquitously expressed member of the mammalian transglutaminase family. TG2 plays a 
      number of important roles in a variety of biological processes. Via its 
      transamidating function, it is responsible for the cross-linking of proteins by 
      forming isopeptide bonds between glutamine and lysine residues. Intracellularly, 
      Ca(2+) activation of the enzyme is normally tightly regulated by the binding of GTP. 
      However, upregulated levels of TG2 are associated with many disease states like 
      celiac sprue, certain types of cancer, fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, multiple 
      sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Selective inhibitors 
      for TG2 both cell penetrating and non-cell penetrating would therefore serve as 
      novel therapeutic tools for the treatment of these disease states. Moreover, they 
      would provide useful tools to fully elucidate the cellular mechanisms TG2 is 
      involved in and help comprehend how the enzyme is regulated at the cellular level. 
      The current paper is intended to give an update on the recently discovered classes 
      of TG2 inhibitors along with their structure-activity relationships. The biological 
      properties of these derivatives, in terms of both activity and selectivity, will 
      also be reported in order to translate their potential for future therapeutic 
      developments.

TI  - Dementia in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 242-54
LID - 10.1007/s11940-011-0121-1 [doi]
AB  - Dementia in Parkinson's disease encompasses a spectrum relating to motor, 
      psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms that are classified as either Dementia with Lewy 
      Bodies (DLB) (initial cognitive symptoms) or Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) 
      (initial motor signs preceding cognitive symptoms by at least a year). 
      Anticholinergic and antipsychotic drugs have a high risk of adverse cognitive and/or 
      motor effects, so their use should be minimized or avoided. Neuroleptic sensitivity 
      is a severe psychomotor adverse reaction that is particularly associated with potent 
      dopamine-blocking agents such as haloperidol. It occurs in up to 50% of individuals 
      with PDD or DLB. Mild psychotic symptoms should first be addressed by reducing 
      anticholinergic and/or dopaminergic agents, if possible. Patients with psychotic 
      symptoms that threaten the safety of the patient or caregiver may benefit from 
      treatment with quetiapine or, in refractory cases, clozapine. Cholinesterase 
      inhibitors as a drug class have been shown to have beneficial effects on cognition 
      in DLB and PDD, and may help to alleviate some psychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, 
      anxiety, hallucinations, and delusions. Memantine may help to moderate cognitive 
      symptoms in DLB and PDD, although current data suggest a more variable response, 
      particularly in PDD. Parkinsonian motor signs that are accompanied by clinically 
      significant cognitive impairment should be treated with carbidopa/levodopa only, as 
      dopamine agonists and other antiparkinsonian medications generally carry a higher 
      risk of provoking or exacerbating psychotic symptoms. Excessive daytime sleepiness 
      and REM sleep behavior disorder are common associated features of PDD and DLB. 
      Minimizing sedating medications during the day and promoting nocturnal sleep may 
      help the daytime sleepiness; melatonin, clonazepam, gabapentin, and possibly 
      memantine may be useful in treating REM sleep behavior disorder. Orthostatic 
      hypotension can be managed with various nonpharmacologic interventions, and if 
      needed, fludrocortisone and pyridostigmine. Midodrine should be used cautiously, if 
      at all.

AB  - This review provides an update on the current state of pharmacogenetic research in 
      the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) as it pertains 
      to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI). AD and LBD are first reviewed from 
      clinical and pathophysiological perspectives. This is followed by a discussion of 
      ChEIs used in the symptomatic treatment of these conditions, focusing on their 
      unique and overlapping pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, which can be 
      used to identify candidate genes for pharmacogenetics studies. The literature 
      published to date is then reviewed and limitations are discussed. This is followed 
      by a discussion of potential endophenotypes which may help to refine future 
      pharmacogenetic studies of response and adverse effects to ChEIs.

TI  - Understanding the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in 
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 83-90
LID - 10.1080/17425255.2018.1417387 [doi]
AB  - Levodopa (L-DOPA) is the most commonly used drug for Parkinson's disease (PD), but 
      its long-term use is associated with various complications, including L-DOPA-induced 
      dyskinesia (LID). Many studies have suggested that L-DOPA neurotoxicity and LID are 
      associated with glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activation. Areas covered: LID is 
      caused by striatal dopamine (DA) denervation in PD and pulsatile L-DOPA treatment. 
      These factors lead to dysregulated DA transmission, abnormal intracellular signaling 
      and transcription factors in striatal neurons, and altered gene expression and 
      plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. The mechanisms of L-DOPA toxicity involve 
      oxidative stress, L-DOPA oxidation to quinone, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
      α-synuclein. GSK-3 has been suggested to play key roles in all the mechanisms 
      associated of L-DOPA toxicity and LID in PD. Expert opinion: GSK-3 plays critical 
      roles in L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity, and the development of specific methods to 
      inhibit GSK-3 function may help prevent L-DOPA neurotoxicity and LID in PD. However, 
      balanced GSK-3 inhibition and less β-catenin degradation is essential for preventing 
      LID, because too much GSK-3 inhibition increases β-catenin levels, which is related 
      to cancers.

TI  - Clinical trials in Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies.
PG  - S109-17
AB  - Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are 
      pathological overlapping and important causes of dementia for which clinical trials 
      are in their infancy. Cholinesterase inhibitors may be of benefit in DLB and PDD, as 
      suggested by placebo-controlled clinical trials of rivastigmine and donepezil. The 
      anti-psychotic agent clozapine has been of benefit in PD and PDD, but other agents, 
      such as quetiapine, require adequate assessment. Barriers to trials include 
      pathological overlap that can lead to inaccuracies in clinical diagnosis, 
      unavailability of a consensus definition for PDD, unanswered questions regarding 
      natural history and the paucity of validated outcome measures. Motor impairment must 
      be considered in patients with PDD and DLB; conversely, cognitive impairment should 
      be assessed in trials targeting motor impairment in advanced PD. Potential targets 
      for treatment include onset of dementia, cognitive impairment, behavioral 
      impairment, functional decline, falls, nursing home placement, mortality, quality of 
      life and economic impact. Biomarkers including neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid 
      markers are not currently established. At present PDD and DLB are distinct entities 
      by definition. Future studies, including clinical trials and biomarker studies, will 
      help to further define the clinical and therapeutic implications of this 
      distinction.

TI  - Selegiline: an appraisal of the basis of its pharmacoeconomic and quality-of-life 
      benefits in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 118-36
AB  - Selegiline (deprenyl) is a selective, irreversible cerebral monoamine oxidase type B 
      inhibitor (MAO-B) that is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It has a 
      relatively mild adverse effect profile without risk of the tyramine ('cheese') 
      reaction at normal therapeutic doses. In about half to two-thirds of patients with 
      mild levodopa response fluctuations, selegiline improves overall disability and 
      'end-of-dose' fluctuations, with a levodopa-sparing effect. Selegiline thus may 
      improve patient quality of life, although formal cost-utility analyses are required 
      to establish the costs of these benefits. Cost-effectiveness studies may help 
      characterise the relative pharmacoeconomic benefits of selegiline and the dopamine 
      agonists, agents which can also be administered as adjuvant therapy at this stage of 
      the disease. There is also evidence to suggest that selegiline may delay the need 
      for levodopa therapy by up to 11 months in patients with early Parkinson's disease, 
      although the relative contribution of neuroprotective and symptomatic effects of 
      selegiline in these patients has yet to be clarified. From a societal perspective, a 
      theoretical analysis indicates that the economic benefits of selegiline therapy are 
      likely to be substantial. An agent which slowed progression of disability by around 
      10% would realise savings, through reduction in both direct and indirect costs, in 
      the order of $US330 million per annum in the United States. Available data suggest 
      that selegiline slows progression of symptoms well in excess of 10%. Further, if a 
      simple and inexpensive method is developed to identify preclinical Parkinson's 
      disease before nigrostriatal damage is advanced, selegiline may be useful in a 
      broader patient population with possible financial benefits to society through 
      reduction of the considerable indirect costs of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Parkinson disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, is 
      associated with selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Although 
      the underlying mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration in PD seem to be 
      multifactorial, mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress are widely considered 
      to be central to many forms of the disease. Whether oxidative stress is a cause or a 
      consequence of dopaminergic death, there is substantial evidence for oxidative 
      stress both in human PD patients and in animal models of PD, especially using 
      rotenone, a complex I inhibitor. There are many indices of oxidative stress, but 
      this review covers the recent evidence for oxidative damage to nucleic acids, 
      lipids, and proteins in both the brain and the peripheral tissues in human PD and in 
      the rotenone model. Limitations of the existing literature and future perspectives 
      are discussed. Understanding how each particular macromolecule is damaged by 
      oxidative stress and the interplay of secondary damage to other biomolecules may 
      help us design better targets for the treatment of PD.

TI  - Treatment of frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 319
LID - 10.1007/s11940-014-0319-0 [doi]
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases 
      with heterogeneous clinical presentations and two predominant types of underlying 
      neuropathology. FTD typically comprises three distinct clinical syndromes: 
      behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic variant primary 
      progressive aphasia (svPPA), and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia 
      (nfvPPA). FTD also frequently overlaps both clinically and neuropathologically with 
      three other neurodegenerative syndromes: corticobasal syndrome (CBS), progressive 
      supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Each syndrome can 
      be associated with one or more underlying neuropathological diagnoses and are 
      referred to as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Although the various FTD 
      syndromes can substantially differ in terms of clinical symptoms and underlying 
      pathology, the symptoms can be broadly categorized into behavioral, cognitive and 
      motor domains. Currently there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
      therapies for the above syndromes except riluzole for ALS. FTD treatment strategies 
      generally rely on off-label use of medications for symptomatic management, and most 
      therapies lack quality evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. 
      For behavioral symptoms, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be effective, 
      while case reports hint at possible efficacy with antipsychotics or anti-epileptics, 
      but use of these latter agents is limited due to concerns regarding side effects. 
      There are no effective therapies for cognitive complaints in FTD, which frequently 
      involve executive function, memory, and language. Motor difficulties associated with 
      FTD may present with parkinsonian symptoms or motor neuron disease, for which 
      riluzole is indicated as therapy. Compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease, 
      FTD-related atypical parkinsonism is generally not responsive to dopamine 
      replacement therapies, but a small percentage of patients may experience improvement 
      with a trial of carbidopa-levodopa. Physical and occupational therapy remain an 
      important corner stone of motor symptom management in FTD. Speech therapy may also 
      help patients manage symptoms associated with aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria. 
      Recent advances in the understanding of FTLD pathophysiology and genetics have led 
      to development of potentially disease-modifying therapies as well as symptomatic 
      therapies aimed at ameliorating social and behavioral deficits.

TI  - Advances in the delivery of treatments for Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1059-73
AB  - Innovative drug delivery in Parkinson's disease (PD) has the potential to reduce or 
      avoid many side effects of current treatment, such as wearing-off type fluctuations, 
      dyskinesia, on-off phenomena or bouts of motor freezing. The traditional orally 
      administered formulations of l-dihydroxyphenylalanine combined with a peripheral 
      aromatic acid decarboxylase inhibitor remain the mainstay of treatments for PD. 
      However, such combination therapies have been further formulated to extend their 
      duration of action by including a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor. Preventing 
      the breakdown of dopamine has also been achieved by monoamine oxidase-B inhibition; 
      this approach now having been formulated for sublingual use (Zelapar, Valeant 
      Pharmaceuticals). An alternative approach bypasses the oral route of administration 
      and instead relies on continuous duodenal infusion (Duodopa, Solvay, NeoPharma AB) 
      for better therapeutic effect. The clinical use of dopamine agonists as 
      antiparkinsonian drugs now incorporates a variety of delivery techniques. For 
      example, apomorphine, which relies on parenteral administration for maximum 
      bioavailability, may be delivered via rectal, intranasal, sublingual and 
      subcutaneous (e.g., Apokyn, Mylan Bertek) routes. Meanwhile, rotigotine and lisuride 
      have both been formulated for delivery via skin patches. Finally, the authors 
      examine more experimental delivery techniques, including the delivery of genes via 
      viral vectors or liposomes, intracranial transplant of a variety of cells and of

TI  - Functional (Nonulcer) Dyspepsia.
PG  - 153-160
AB  - Functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia refers to upper abdominal pain or discomfort with or 
      without symptoms of early satiety, nausea, or vomiting with no definable organic 
      cause. The current Rome II criteria help to diagnose functional dyspepsia and avoid 
      misdiagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome as 
      functional dyspepsia. Assessment of gastric emptying with scintigraphy or breath 
      testing may be useful in identifying delayed gastric emptying in patients with 
      dyspeptic symptoms and may be helpful in patient management. Electrogastrography is 
      a noninvasive test that evaluates for gastric dysrhythmias. Satiety testing is being 
      evaluated as an indirect test for impaired fundic relaxation and visceral 
      hypersensitivity. The symptom response to Helicobacter pylori therapy in patients 
      with functional dyspepsia and a negative endoscopy examination but a positive H. 
      pylori test is marginal. Lifestyle modifications often are suggested for initial 
      treatment of functional dyspepsia. Dietary changes such as frequent small meals, 
      low-fat diet, and avoidance of certain aggravating foods may improve symptoms. 
      Additional measures include cessation of smoking, avoiding excess alcohol intake, 
      and minimizing coffee intake. Antacids and over-the-counter histamine type 2 
      receptor antagonists may be helpful as an "on-demand" therapy for intermittent 
      symptoms. They are safe and relatively inexpensive. Different subgroups of 
      functional dyspepsia are based on the predominant symptom and may help in choosing 
      an appropriate drug to initiate therapy. If the predominant symptom is epigastric 
      pain (ulcer-like functional dyspepsia), histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton 
      pump inhibitors are the initial treatment of choice. If fullness, bloating, early 
      satiety or nausea is the predominant complaint (dysmotility-like functional 
      dyspepsia), a prokinetic agent may help. Metoclopramide is the only available 
      effective prokinetic agent at present. If metoclopramide is used, short-term 
      treatment and discussion of possible side effects with the patient are advised. If 
      there is no response to these initial treatments, switching therapy from proton pump 
      inhibitor to prokinetic or vice versa can be tried. If these treatment options fail, 
      patient re-evaluation for other disorders (including other functional bowel 
      disorders) is advised. A low-dose tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime may be helpful 
      for treatment of visceral hypersensitivity.

AB  - Until recently, neuroscience has given sleep research and discovery of better 
      treatments of sleep disturbances little attention, despite the fact that disturbed 
      sleep has overwhelming impact on human health. Sleep is a complex phenomenon in 
      which specific psychological, electrophysiological, neurochemical, endocrinological, 
      immunological and genetic factors are involved. The brain as both the generator and 
      main object of sleep is obviously of particular interest, which makes a 
      neuroscience-driven view the most promising approach to evaluate clinical 
      implications and applications of sleep research. Polysomnography as the gold 
      standard of sleep research, complemented by brain imaging, neuroendocrine testing, 
      genomics and other laboratory measures can help to create composite biomarkers that 
      allow maximizing the effects of individualized therapies while minimizing adverse 
      effects. Here we review the current state of the neuroscience of sleep, sleep 
      disorders and sleep therapeutics and will give some leads to promote the discovery 
      and development of sleep medicines that are better than those we have today.

AB  - The World Parkinson Congress, which was recently held in Glasgow, aimed to establish 
      a worldwide dialogue to help expedite the discovery of a cure and best treatment 
      practices for Parkinson's disease. The congress brought together experts from a 
      range of disciplines, from basic sciences to translational research and clinical 
      sciences to models of care. International governmental organisations and 
      professional societies were also present in force. The Parkinson's community was 
      represented by the many people with the condition who attended and their carers, as 
      well as national and international voluntary associations. This complete spectrum of 
      individuals and entities involved in the search for a cure and deciding on the best 
      care for Parkinson's disease provided the perfect conditions for a globally reaching 
      discourse on the condition.

TI  - Tetrabenazine for the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders: a review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 1487-504
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2012.06.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tetrabenazine (TBZ) is a monoamine storage inhibitor that was first 
      introduced in the 1970s for the management of hyperkinetic movement disorders. 
      Despite acceptance and usage worldwide, TBZ was only recently approved in the United 
      States for the treatment of Huntington chorea. This review focuses on the use of TBZ 
      in various hyperkinetic movement disorders, which are considered "rare" or "orphan" 
      diseases, to help practitioners better understand its clinical role and use. 
      OBJECTIVE: This review describes the clinical efficacy and tolerability of TBZ in 
      the management of dystonia, Huntington chorea, tardive dyskinesia (TDk), and tic 
      disorders. METHODS: A Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MedlinePlus, PubMed, and clinical 
      trials database search (up to May 2012) was conducted to identify articles and 
      studies using the subject terms tetrabenazine, Huntington disease, dystonia, tardive 
      dyskinesia, Tourette, tics, and hyperkinetic movement. Only English-language 
      articles were reviewed. RESULTS: TBZ variably undergoes extensive first-pass 
      metabolism to active metabolites, some of which are metabolized by the cytochrome 
      P450 2D6 isozyme. Pharmacology studies demonstrate that TBZ reversibly inhibits the 
      activity of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, resulting in depletion of central 
      dopamine. For management of dystonias, 1 of 3 small prospective blinded studies and 
      4 of 5 retrospective studies reported clinical benefit with TBZ use in pediatrics 
      and adults. For Huntington chorea, 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
      studies along with open-label studies demonstrate the effectiveness of TBZ in 
      adults. For TDk, 9 of 11 studies (prospective controlled and retrospective) reported 
      positive benefit. For Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, 9 of 11 studies (prospective 
      controlled and retrospective) reported positive benefit on motor and phonic tics in 
      pediatric and adult patients. Overall, adverse effects are dose and age related and 
      include depression, fatigue, parkinsonism, and somnolence. CONCLUSIONS: TBZ is an 
      effective oral therapy for chorea of Huntington disease and may be considered as an 
      alternative agent for the management of dystonia, TDk, and tic disorders (these 
      latter 3 conditions are off-label uses in the United States). The drug possesses an 
      acceptable tolerability profile and has been used in pediatric and adult 
      populations.

PG  - 18-25
LID - 10.1159/000330016 [doi]
AB  - Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling 
      electrical peripheral stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of 
      the motor cortex. The short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) is reduced in 
      cholinergic forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy 
      bodies, while it is normal in non-cholinergic forms of dementia, such as 
      frontotemporal dementia. This finding suggests that this method can be used as a 
      non-invasive additional tool for discriminating between cholinergic and 
      non-cholinergic forms of dementia. Interestingly, SAI was also found to be 
      significantly smaller in early AD patients. Identification of SAI abnormalities that 
      occur early in the course of AD will allow earlier diagnosis and treatment with 
      cholinergic drugs. In patients with vascular dementia, SAI responses varied widely; 
      the number of patients with abnormal SAI conceivably reflects the percentage of 
      subjects with a significant cholinergic dysfunction. It has recently been 
      demonstrated that brain microbleeds have an impact on SAI that is independent of the 
      extent of associated white matter changes and ischemic stroke. Since SAI can be 
      increased by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, TMS may help in identifying the 
      patients who would be suitable for long-term treatment with cholinergic agents.

TI  - Tackling dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 15-7, 2
AB  - Dementia more than one year after the onset of motor features associated with 
      Parkinson's disease is defined as Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). If it 
      develops within one year of the motor features, the term dementia with Lewy bodies 
      (DLB) is used. Since clinical and pathological features are similar, it is generally 
      accepted that both represent a continuum of the same disorder. PDD together with DLB 
      account for around one fifth of all cases of dementia in the elderly. Studies 
      suggest that most patients with Parkinson's disease would eventually develop 
      dementia if they lived long enough. The diagnosis of PDD in the presence of 
      long-standing pronounced motor features rarely poses a diagnostic dilemma. However, 
      the diagnosis of DLB may be more difficult. It relies on the revised consensus 
      clinical criteria which require the presence of at least two of the following three 
      syndromes: persistent visual hallucinations, fluctuating defects in cognitive and 
      functional ability, and parkinsonism. An early referral to a specialist clinic may 
      not only help to confirm the diagnosis, but also to co-ordinate the group of 
      professionals working with the patient. Well lit rooms and the use of glasses and 
      hearing aids can help to reduce hallucinations. Cholinesterase inhibitors used in 
      Alzheimer's disease have a role in DLB and PDD. Trials show moderate improvements in 
      cognitive function in patients treated with rivastigmine. The greatest impact, 
      however, seems to be on the psychotic features of the disease. Patients with DLB are 
      less likely to have a good motor response from L-dopa than patients with Parkinson's 
      disease or PDD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A greater understanding of the everyday experiences of people with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and their carers may help improve clinical practice. 
      OBJECTIVE: The Parkinson's Real-world Impact assesSMent (PRISM) study evaluated 
      medication use, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the use of healthcare 
      resources by people with PD and their carers. METHODS: PRISM is an observational 
      cross-sectional study, in which people with PD and their carers completed an online 
      survey using structured questionnaires, including the Parkinson's Disease Quality of 
      Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39), Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) and Zarit 
      Burden Interview (ZBI). RESULTS: Data were collected from 861 people with PD (mean 
      age, 65.0 years; mean disease duration, 7.7 years) and 256 carers from six European 
      countries. People with PD reported a large number of different co-morbidities, 
      non-motor symptoms (mean NMSQuest score, 12.8), and impaired HRQoL (median PDQ-39 
      summary score, 29.1). Forty-five percent of people with PD reported at least one 
      impulse control behaviour. Treatment patterns varied considerably between different 
      European countries. Levodopa was taken in the last 12 months by 85.9% of 
      participants, and as monotherapy by 21.8%. Carers, who were mostly female (64.8%) 
      and the partner/spouse of the person with PD (82.1%), reported mild to moderate 
      burden (mean ZBI total score, 26.6). CONCLUSIONS: The PRISM study sheds light on the 
      lives of people with PD and those who care for them, re-emphasising the many 
      challenges they face in everyday life. The study also provides insights into the 
      current treatment of PD in Europe.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in degenerative parkinsonisms: role of radionuclide brain 
      imaging.
PG  - 55-67
AB  - Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes 
      is gaining increased clinical significance. The neurochemical and neuropathological 
      basis in the various parkinsonian forms and even in an individual patient are not 
      fully elucidated yet and could be heterogeneous. Loss of dopaminergic, cholinergic 
      and noradrenergic innervation has been suggested to be the underlying neurochemical 
      deficits for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD, but the onset of cognitive 
      impairment and the progression to dementia may not share the same underlying 
      neurochemical basis. Similarly, pathological evidence is also heterogeneous, ranging 
      from subcortical pathology, limbic or cortical Lewy body type degeneration, and 
      Alzheimer's type pathology that can be found even in the same patient with PD 
      dementia (PDD). Typically, the prototype of early cognitive deficit in PD is a 
      dysexecutive syndrome, but other cognitive domains are more involved when dementia 
      develops, mainly including visuospatial, language and memory dysfunction. Functional 
      radionuclide neuroimaging, by means of single-photon emission computed tomography 
      and positron emission tomography, are contributing to characterize the topographic 
      cortical pattern of cognitive impairment, as well as to define the underlying 
      neurochemical deficit. Lastly, the advent of amyloid PET may help clarifying the 
      meaning of amyloid load in diffuse Lewy body disease and PDD. Knowing the 
      neurochemical and pathophysiological substrate of cognitive deficit in patients with 
      PD or other degenerative Parkinsonisms may help the clinician in understanding the 
      clinical condition of an individual patient in order to plan pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological intervention. The introduction of acetylcholinesterase 
      inhibitors for therapy of PDD is an example of information integration between 
      clinical-neuropsychological and pathophysiological-neurochemical aspects obtained 
      also with the key contribution of functional neuroimaging.

TI  - Neuroproteomics approach and neurosystems biology analysis: ROCK inhibitors as 
      promising therapeutic targets in neurodegeneration and neurotrauma.
PG  - 3659-68
LID - 10.1002/elps.201200470 [doi]
AB  - Several common degenerative mechanisms and mediators underlying the neuronal injury 
      pathways characterize several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, 
      Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, as well as brain neurotrauma. Such common 
      ground invites the emergence of new approaches and tools to study the altered 
      pathways involved in neural injury alongside with neuritogenesis, an intricate 
      process that commences with neuronal differentiation. Achieving a greater 
      understanding of the impaired pathways of neuritogenesis would significantly help in 
      uncovering detailed mechanisms of axonal regeneration. Among the several agents 
      involved in neuritogenesis are the Rho and Rho kinases (ROCKs), which constitute key 
      integral points in the Rho/ROCK pathway that is known to be disrupted in multiple 
      neuropathologies such as spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's 
      disease. This in turn renders ROCK inhibition as a promising candidate for 
      therapeutic targets for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Among the novel 
      tools to investigate the mechanisms involved in a specific disorder is the use of 
      neuroproteomics/systems biology approach, a growing subfield of bioinformatics 
      aiming to study and establishing a global assessment of the entire neuronal 
      proteome, addressing the dynamic protein changes and interactions. This review aims 
      to examine recent updates regarding how neuroproteomics aids in the understanding of 
      molecular mechanisms of activation and inhibition in the area of neurogenesis and 
      how Rho/ROCK pathway/ROCK inhibitors, primarily Y-27632 and Fasudil compounds, are 
      applied in biological settings, promoting neuronal survival and neuroprotection that 
      has direct future implications in neurotrauma.

TI  - Novel Thiosemicarbazone Derivatives: In Vitro and In Silico Evaluation as Potential 
      MAO-B Inhibitors.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26216640 [doi]
LID - 6640
AB  - MAO-B inhibitors are frequently used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases 
      such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Due to the limited number of compounds 
      available in this field, there is a need to develop new compounds. In the recent 
      works, it was shown that various thiosemicarbazone derivatives show hMAO inhibitory 
      activity in the range of micromolar concentration. It is thought that benzofuran and 
      benzothiophene structures may mimic structures such as indane and indanone, which 
      are frequently found in the structures of such inhibitors. Based on this view, new 
      benzofuran/benzothiophene and thiosemicarbazone hybrid compounds were synthesized, 
      characterized and screened for their hMAO-A and hMAO-B inhibitory activity by an in 
      vitro fluorometric method. The compounds including methoxyethyl substituent (2b and 
      2h) were found to be the most effective agents in the series against MAO-B enzyme 
      with the IC(50) value of 0.042 ± 0.002 µM and 0.056 ± 0.002 µM, respectively. The 
      mechanism of hMAO-B inhibition of compounds 2b and 2h was investigated by 
      Lineweaver-Burk graphics. Compounds 2b and 2h were reversible and non-competitive 
      inhibitors with similar inhibition features as the substrates. The K(i) values of 
      compounds 2b and 2h were calculated as 0.035 µM and 0.046 µM, respectively, with the 
      help of secondary plots. The docking study of compound 2b and 2h revealed that there 
      is a strong interaction between the active sites of hMAO-B and analyzed compound.

TI  - The utility of EEG in dementia: a clinical perspective.
PG  - 1038-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite being simple and cheap, the EEG is not often used in clinical 
      practice. METHODOLOGY: Literature search using PUBMED and Medline. RESULTS: 
      Quantitative EEG can help to identify mild dementia and mild cognitive impairment 
      and can increase diagnostic accuracy when used with other imaging techniques. EEG 
      helps differentiate organic from functional brain disease and predict response to 
      cholinesterase inhibitors and is central in the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt Jacob 
      disease. The accuracy of EEG may be greater than that of CT or MRI scans alone. 
      DISCUSSION: Quantitative EEG may save on specialist interpretation time and enable 
      more routine use of EEG in diagnosis and care. More widespread use of EEG's is 
      indicated. Agreement on the parameters that are best measured on qEEG is still 
      awaited.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep disorders are prevalent in patients with a neurocognitive 
      disorder, and diagnosis and treatment in these patients remain challenging in 
      clinical practice. METHODS: This narrative review offers a systematic approach to 
      diagnose and treat sleep disorders in neurocognitive disorders. RESULTS: Alzheimer's 
      disease is often associated with circadian rhythm disorders, chronic insomnia, and 
      sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. Alpha-synucleinopathies (e.g., Parkinson's disease 
      and Lewy body dementia) are often associated with a rapid eye movement sleep 
      behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, chronic insomnia, and sleep 
      apnea-hypopnea syndrome. A focused history allows to diagnose most sleep disorders. 
      Clinicians should ensure to gather the following information in all patients with a 
      neurocognitive disorder: (1) the presence of difficulties falling asleep or staying 
      asleep, (2) the impact of sleep disturbances on daily functioning (fatigue, 
      sleepiness and other daytime consequences), and (3) abnormal movements in sleep. 
      Sleep diaries and questionnaires can assist clinicians in screening for specific 
      sleep disorders. Polysomnography is recommended if a rapid eye movement sleep 
      behavior disorder or a sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome are suspected. Sleep complaints 
      should prompt clinicians to ensure that comorbidities interfering with sleep are 
      properly managed. The main treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep 
      apnea-hypopnea syndrome remains continuous positive airway pressure, as its efficacy 
      has been demonstrated in patients with neurocognitive disorders. Medications should 
      also be reviewed, and time of administration should be optimized (diuretics and 
      stimulating medications in the morning, sedating medications in the evening). 
      Importantly, cholinesterase inhibitors (especially donepezil) may trigger insomnia. 
      Switching to morning dosing or to an alternative drug may help. Cognitive-behavioral 
      therapy for insomnia is indicated to treat chronic insomnia in neurocognitive 
      disorders. False beliefs regarding sleep should be addressed with the patient and 
      their caregiver. The sleep environment should be optimized (decrease light exposure 
      at night, minimize noise, avoid taking vital signs, etc.). Sleep restriction can be 
      considered as patients with a neurocognitive disorder often spend too much time in 
      bed. The need for naps should be assessed case by case as naps may contribute to 
      insomnia in some patients but allow others to complete their diurnal activities. 
      Trazodone (50mg) may also be used under certain circumstances in chronic insomnia. 
      Recent evidence does not support a role for exogenous melatonin in patients with a 
      neucognitive disorder and insomnia. Patients in long-term care facilities are often 
      deprived of an adequate diurnal exposure to light. Increasing daytime exposure to 
      light may improve sleep and mood. Patients with circadian rhythm disorders can also 
      benefit from light therapy (morning bright light therapy in case of phase delay and 
      evening bright light therapy in case of phase advance). Rapid eye movement sleep 
      behavior disorder can lead to violent behaviors, and the sleeping environment should 
      be secured (e.g., mattress on the floor, remove surrounding objects). Medication 
      exacerbating this disorder should be stopped if possible. High dose melatonin (6 to 
      18mg) or low dose clonazepam (0.125-0.25mg) at bedtime may be used to reduce 
      symptoms. Melatonin is preferred in first-line as it is generally well tolerated 
      with few side effects. Patients with restless legs syndrome should be investigated 
      for iron deficiency. Medication decreasing dopaminergic activity should be reduced 
      or stopped if possible. Behavioral strategies such as exercise and leg massages may 
      be beneficial. Low-dose dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole 0.125mg two hours 
      before bedtime) can be used to treat the condition, but a prolonged treatment may 
      paradoxically worsen the symptoms. Alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands can also be 
      used while monitoring for the risk of falls. CONCLUSION: Multiple and sustained 
      nonpharmacological approaches are recommended for the treatment of sleep 
      disturbances in patients with neurocognitive disorder. Pharmacological indications 
      remain limited, and further randomized clinical trials integrating a multimodal 
      approach are warranted to evaluate the treatment of sleep disorders in specific 
      neurocognitive disorders.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread worldwide, and 
      finding a safe therapeutic strategy and effective vaccine is critical to overcoming 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, elucidation 
      of pathogenesis mechanisms, especially entry routes of SARS-CoV-2 may help propose 
      antiviral drugs and novel vaccines. Several receptors have been demonstrated for the 
      interaction of spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with host cells, including 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), ephrin ligands and Eph receptors, neuropilin 1 
      (NRP-1), P2X7, and CD147. The expression of these entry receptors in the central 
      nervous system (CNS) may make the CNS prone to SARS-CoV-2 invasion, leading to 
      neurodegenerative diseases. The present review provides potential pathological 
      mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS, including entry receptors and 
      cytokines involved in neuroinflammatory conditions. Moreover, it explains several 
      neurodegenerative disorders associated with COVID-19. Finally, we suggest 
      inflammasome and JaK inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategies for 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - MAPT-Related Disorders – RETIRED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION HAS BEEN RETIRED. THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL 
      REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: 
      The clinical manifestations of MAPT-related disorders (MAPT-related tauopathies) are 
      most typically those of frontotemporal dementia (FTDP-17), but also include 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), mild 
      late-onset parkinsonism, and dementia with epilepsy. Clinical presentation of 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is variable: some present with slowly progressive 
      behavioral changes, language disturbances, and/or extrapyramidal signs, whereas 
      others present with rigidity, bradykinesia, supranuclear palsy, and saccadic eye 
      movement disorders. Onset is usually between ages 40 and 60 years, but may be 
      earlier or later. The disease progresses over a few years into profound dementia 
      with mutism. PSP is characterized by progressive vertical gaze palsy in combination 
      with a prominent loss of balance at early stages of the disease. With progression, 
      axial rigidity, dysarthria, and dysphagia become prominent, often in combination 
      with a frontal dysexecutive syndrome. CBD is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder which affects both the frontoparietal cortex and the basal ganglia, 
      resulting in a mild to moderate dementia in combination with asymmetric 
      parkinsonism, ideomotor apraxia, aphasia, and an alien-hand syndrome. 
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of a MAPT- related disorder relies on: typical 
      clinical findings; often on characteristic findings on neuroimaging, single-photon 
      emission computed tomography (SPECT), or positron emission tomography with 
      (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET); a positive family history; and most importantly, 
      demonstration of a pathogenic variant in MAPT, the gene encoding the protein tau. 
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Sedative or antipsychotic drugs help to 
      reduce extreme restlessness, roaming behavior, delusions, and hallucinations; 
      seizures are treated in the customary manner. Psychological support for partners or 
      other caregivers is essential. Extrapyramidal signs are usually unresponsive or only 
      partially responsive to L-dopa treatment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine may increase cognitive 
      impairment in persons with FTD. GENETIC COUNSELING: MAPT-related disorders are 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with a 
      MAPT-related disorder have had an affected parent; however, because of the late 
      onset and relatively rapid course of the disease, the affected parent has often died 
      before onset of the disease in the offspring. De novo pathogenic variants are 
      extremely rare. Each child of an individual with a MAPT-related disorder has a 50% 
      chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at 
      increased risk is possible when the disease-causing allele in the family is known; 
      however, requests for prenatal diagnosis of (typically) adult-onset diseases are not 
      common.

TI  - Parkinson's disease: making the diagnosis, selecting drug therapies.
PG  - 14-6, 20-3
AB  - Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition of unknown cause 
      and with no known cure. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings of rest tremor, 
      muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait instability. Over 40% of patients develop a 
      dementia syndrome that is largely distinct from Alzheimer's disease. Depression is 
      common, also occurring in more than 40% of patients with PD. Careful evaluation in 
      necessary to help distinguish Parkinson's disease from secondary causes of 
      parkinsonism. Carbidopa/levodopa, dopamine agonists, and monoamine oxidase type B 
      inhibitors are the mainstays of treatment. Anticholinergics and other agents may 
      also be useful. Pharmacologic treatment must be carefully titrated to control 
      symptoms and to avoid side effects. In advanced disease, dose-related dyskinesias, 
      end-of-dose wearing-off effect, and unpredictable sudden motor fluctuations become 
      very disabling and difficult to manage.

TI  - Parkinson's disease management: towards a new paradigm.
PG  - S53-7
AB  - Over the past decade, management of Parkinson's disease has changed significantly 
      due to the expansion of medical and surgical treatment modalities. Neurologists now 
      have the ability (and the challenge) of choosing from multiple medications to devise 
      an individual management strategy for each patient depending on his/her clinical 
      symptoms and needs. Several different surgical therapies are also available. The 
      topics covered in this supplement have highlighted the new options that are now 
      available, as well as the treatments that have been in clinical usage. This review 
      attempts to synthesize the information that is currently available in an attempt to

TI  - Targeting the dopamine D3 receptor: an overview of drug design strategies.
PG  - 641-64
LID - 10.1080/17460441.2016.1185413 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter widely distributed in both the 
      periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). Its physiological effects are 
      mediated by five closely related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are 
      divided into two major subclasses: the D1-like (D1, D5) and the D2-like (D2, D3, D4) 
      receptors. D3 receptors (D3Rs) have the highest density in the limbic areas of the 
      brain, which are associated with cognitive and emotional functions. These receptors 
      are therefore attractive targets for therapeutic management. AREAS COVERED: This 
      review summarizes the functional and pharmacological characteristics of D3Rs, 
      including the design and clinical relevance of full agonists, partial agonists and 
      antagonists, as well as the capacity of these receptors to form active homodimers, 
      heterodimers or higher order receptor complexes as pharmacological targets in 
      several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. EXPERT OPINION: The high 
      sequence homology between D3R and the D2-type challenges the development of 
      D3R-selective compounds. The design of new D3R-preferential ligands with improved 
      physicochemical properties should provide a better pharmacokinetic/bioavailability 
      profile and lesser toxicity than is found with existing D3R ligands. It is also 
      essential to optimize D3R affinity and, especially, D3R vs. D2-type binding and 
      functional selectivity ratios. Developing allosteric and bitopic ligands should help 
      to improve the D3R selectivity of these drugs. As most evidence points to the 
      ability of GPCRs to form homomers and heteromers, the most promising therapeutic 
      strategy in the future is likely to involve the application of heteromer-selective 
      drugs. These selective ligands would display different affinities for a given 
      receptor depending on the receptor partners within the heteromer. Therefore, 
      designing novel compounds that specifically target and modulate D1R-D3R heteromers 
      would be an interesting approach for the treatment of levodopa (L-DOPA)-induced 
      dyskinesias.

AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and casein kinase 1δ (CK-1δ) are emerging 
      targets for the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders, including Parkinson's 
      disease. An inhibitor able to target these two kinases was developed by 
      docking-based design. Compound 12, 
      3-(7-amino-5-(cyclohexylamino)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylamide, 
      showed combined inhibitory activity against GSK-3β and CK-1δ [IC(50) 
      (GSK-3β)=0.17 μm; IC(50) (CK-1δ)=0.68 μm]. In particular, classical ATP competition 
      was observed against CK-1δ, and a co-crystal of compound 12 inside GSK-3β confirmed 
      a covalent interaction between the cyanoacrylamide warhead and Cys199, which could 
      help in the development of more potent covalent inhibitors of GSK-3β. Preliminary 
      studies on in vitro models of Parkinson's disease revealed that compound 12 is not 
      cytotoxic and shows neuroprotective activity. These results encourage further 
      investigations to validate GSK-3β/CK-1δ inhibition as a possible new strategy to 
      treat neuroinflammatory/degenerative diseases.

AB  - Up-regulation of CB2R on activated microglial cells, the first step in 
      neurodegeneration, has been widely demonstrated, and this finding makes the receptor 
      a promising target in the early diagnosis and treatment of several neurodegenerative 
      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of CB2R PET ligands could 
      help demonstrate the neurodegenerative pathogenesis, thus providing useful tools for 
      characterizing the role of neuroinflammation in the progression of these disorders. 
      CB2R agonists and inverse agonists have emerged as neuroprotective agents, and CB2R 
      agonists have entered several clinical trials. CB2R ligands have therefore received 
      great attention, and different molecular scaffolds have been selected to target CB2R 
      subtypes. This review is focused on structure-activity relationship (SAR) and 
      structure-affinity relationship (SAfiR) studies performed on different scaffolds 
      with the aim to identify the molecular features useful for the design of both 
      therapeutic and diagnostic agents.

PG  - 525-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some 10%-15% of patients with dementia are diagnosed as dementia with 
      Lewy bodies (DLB), a disorder characterised by the presence of Lewy bodies in the 
      brainstem and cortex. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of pathology, clinical symptoms, 
      pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment, based on the literature and on 
      personal experience. RESULTS: Neurochemical findings are marked cortical reduction 
      of acetylcholine and nigrostriatal dopamine deficiency. Key features of the clinical 
      syndrome are dementia, fluctuating consciousness, visual hallucinations and 
      parkinsonism. There are pathological and clinical overlaps between DLB and 
      Alzheimer's disease on the one hand, and between DLB and Parkinson's disease on the 
      other; the relationship between these diseases awaits further elucidation. Clinical 
      consensus criteria for DLB have been published and shown to have high sensitivity 
      and specificity. Fluctuating consciousness may be difficult to detect, but 
      diagnostic instruments exist that may help in the evaluation. Drug treatment of DLB 
      is difficult. Cholinesterase inhibitors have been shown to improve cognition and 
      psychiatric symptoms. Atypical antipsychotics may improve psychosis, but some 
      patients develop severe sensitivity reactions. The effect of antiparkinson agents is 
      unknown.

      disease.
LID - 10.2174/1389557521666210927151553 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parkinson's disease is a pervasive neuro disorder that affects people's 
      quality of life throughout the world. The unsatisfactory results of clinical rating 
      scales open the door for more research. PD treatment using current biomarkers seems 
      a difficult task. So automatic evaluation at an early stage may enhance the quality 
      and time-period of life. METHODS: Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) and Population, intervention, comparison, and 
      outcome (PICO) search methodology schemes are followed to search the data and 
      eligible studies for this survey. Approximate 1500 articles were extracted using 
      related search strings. After the stepwise mapping and elimination of studies, 94 
      papers are found suitable for the present review. RESULTS: After the quality 
      assessment of extracted studies, nine inhibitors are identified to analyze people's 
      gait with Parkinson's disease, where four are critical. This review also 
      differentiates the various machine learning classification techniques with their PD 
      analysis characteristics in previous studies. The extracted research gaps are 
      described as future perspectives. Results can help practitioners understand the PD 
      gait as a valuable biomarker for detection, quantification, and classification. 
      CONCLUSION: Due to less cost and easy recording of gait, gait-based techniques are 
      becoming popular in PD detection. By encapsulating the gait-based studies, it gives 
      an in-depth knowledge of PD, different measures that affect gait detection and 
      classification.

TI  - Cholinesterase inhibitors in advanced Dementia with Lewy bodies: increase or stop?
PG  - 719-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is little data on stopping cholinesterase inhibitors in Dementia 
      with Lewy bodies (DLB). Equally, it is not known if increasing the dose of 
      cholinesterase inhibitors may help neuropsychiatric symptoms in advanced DLB. 
      METHOD: We conducted an open label trial with donepezil involving 16 patients with 
      LBD when the dose was reduced and treatment stopped over 4 weeks. Another 7 patients 
      were given a trial of an increased dose of donepezil (15 mg) to resolve 
      rehyphen;emergent neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: The slow discontinuation 
      protocol was well tolerated in advanced DLB. Five of the seven patients given a 
      trial of a higher dose of donepezil were rated as clinically improved after 12 weeks 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Cholinesterase inhibitors can be discontinued slowly in 
      advanced DLB. Increasing the dose of donepezil may be of benefit to some patients 
      with DLB who experience a recurrence in their neuropsychiatric symptoms.

TI  - Nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptors: pharmacology and clinical implications.
PG  - 117-35
AB  - The advance of functional genomics revealed the superfamily of G-protein coupled 
      receptors (GPCRs). Hundreds of GPCRs have been cloned but many of them are orphan 
      GPCRs with unidentified ligands. The first identified orphan GPCR is the opioid 
      receptor like orphan receptor, ORL1. It was cloned in 1994 during the identification 
      of opioid receptor subtypes and was de-orphanized in 1995 by the discovery of its 
      endogenous ligand, nociceptin or orphanin FQ (N/OFQ). This receptor was renamed as 
      N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor. Several selective ligands acting at NOP receptors or 
      other anti-N/OFQ agents have been reported. These include N/OFQ-derived peptides 
      acting as agonists (cyclo[Cys(10),Cys(14)]N/OFQ, [Arg(14), Lys(15)]N/OFQ, 
      [pX]Phe(4)N/OFQ(1-13)-NH(2), UFP-102, [(pF)Phe(4),Aib(7), 
      Aib(11),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2)) or antagonists 
      (Phe(1)psi(CH(2)-NH)Gly(2)]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH(2), [Nphe(1)]N/OFQ(1-13)-NH(2), UFP-101, 
      [Nphe(1), (pF)Phe(4),Aib(7),Aib(11),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2)), hexapeptides, 
      other peptide derivatives (peptide III-BTD, ZP-120, OS-461, OS-462, OS-500), 
      non-peptide agonists (NNC 63-0532, Ro 64-6198, (+)-5a compound, W-212393, 
      3-(4-piperidinyl)indoles, 3-(4-piperidinyl) pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines) and antagonists 
      (TRK-820, J-113397, JTC-801, octahydrobenzimidazol-2-ones, 
      2-(1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-1 H-indole, N-benzyl-D-prolines, SB-612111), biostable RNA 
      Spiegelmers specific against N/OFQ, and a functional antagonist, nocistatin. 
      Buprenorphine and naloxone benzoylhydrazone are two opioid receptor ligands showing 
      high affinity for NOP receptors. NOP receptor agonists might be beneficial in the 
      treatment of pain, anxiety, stress-induced anorexia, cough, neurogenic bladder, 
      edema, drug dependence, and, less promising, in cerebral ischemia and epilepsy, 
      while antagonists might be of help in the management of pain, depression, dementia 
      and Parkinsonism. N/OFQ is also involved in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and 
      immune regulation. Altered plasma levels of N/OFQ have been reported in patients 
      with various pain states, depression and liver diseases. This review summarizes the 
      pharmacological characteristics of, and studies with, the available NOP receptor 
      ligands and their possible clinical implications.

TI  - Attenuation of apomorphine-induced sensitization by buspirone.
PG  - 444-50
LID - 10.1016/j.pbb.2011.04.007 [doi]
AB  - Apomorphine, a dopamine D₁/D₂ agonist is effective in the treatment of Parkinson's 
      disease; but its long term use is often associated with the dependence and 
      addiction. The development of locomotor sensitization to psychostimulants including 
      apomorphine is considered to be an important contributor to psychostimulant drug 
      abuse. Previous studies have shown that long term administration of drugs of abuse 
      increases the effectiveness of somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-1A 
      receptors. Repeated administration of buspirone attenuates the effectiveness of 
      somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors. The present study was designed to test the 
      hypothesis that coadministration of buspirone may attenuate apomorphine induced 
      sensitization. Administration of apomorphine at a dose of 1.0, 2.0 & 4.0mg/kg 
      increased motor activity in an activity box in a dose dependent manner. Locomotor 
      enhancing effects of a low dose of apomorphine were augmented upon repeated 
      administration suggesting drug-induced sensitization. The sensitization effects were 
      significant in an activity box as well as in an open field. Coadministration of 
      buspirone at a dose of 1.0mg/kg reversed apomorphine-induced sensitization. Repeated 
      administration of buspirone at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg but not 1.0 mg/kg also elicited 
      sensitization in motor behavior. It is suggested that buspirone may oppose the 
      development of sensitization to apomorphine by decreasing the sensitivity of 
      somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors. Findings may help in extending therapeutics in 
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease: epidemiology and management.
PG  - 733-9
AB  - Sleep problems are an under-emphasised cause of disability in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) and may be seen independently of PD, associated with primary PD pathology, or 
      as a result of antiparkinsonian medications. Common sleep disorders include 
      excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, 
      night-time wakefulness and restless legs syndrome. A number of strategies may be 
      used to improve sleep cycle disturbances, and often these interventions do not 
      require pharmacological manipulation. Restoring traditional mealtimes and scheduling 
      activities during predicted periods of sleepiness may help alleviate daytime 
      somnolence; the use of controlled-release levodopa preparations or administration of 
      a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor with levodopa at bedtime may reduce 
      periods of night-time wakefulness. Administration of clonazepam at bedtime may 
      assist with REM sleep behaviour disorder but, because this agent can result in 
      daytime somnolence, experimentation with dosage times is recommended. Sleep attacks 
      are described as a sudden, unavoidable transition from wakefulness to sleep and, 
      although rare, have been described with pramipexole, ropinirole and other dopamine 
      agonists. Although the condition has yet to be recognised by the International 
      Association of Sleep Disorders, patients with PD who report rapid sleep onset should 
      be evaluated for the possibility of sleep attacks. If sleep attacks are suspected, 
      it is reasonable to strongly caution patients regarding potentially risk-associated 
      activities such as driving, and to consider careful withdrawal of dopaminergic 
      therapy.

TI  - Neuron-autonomous susceptibility to induced synuclein aggregation is exacerbated by

PG  - fcz052
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcz052 [doi]

AB  - Neuronal aggregates containing α-synuclein are a pathological hallmark of several 
      degenerative diseases; including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with 
      dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. Understanding the process of α-synuclein 
      aggregation, and discovering means of preventing it, may help guide therapeutic 
      strategy and drug design. Recent advances provide tools to induce α-synuclein 
      aggregation in neuronal cultures. Application of exogenous pre-formed fibrillar 
      α-synuclein induces pathological phosphorylation and accumulation of endogenous 
      α-synuclein, typical of that seen in disease. Genomic variability and mutations in 
      α-synuclein and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 proteins are the major genetic risk 
      factors for Parkinson's disease. Reports demonstrate fibril-induced α-synuclein 
      aggregation is increased in cells from leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 pathogenic 
      mutant (G2019S) overexpressing mice, and variously decreased by leucine-rich repeat 
      kinase 2 inhibitors. Elsewhere in vivo antisense knock-down of leucine-rich repeat 
      kinase 2 protein has been shown to protect mice from fibril-induced α-synuclein 
      aggregation, whereas kinase inhibition did not. To help bring clarity to this issue, 
      we took a purely genetic approach in a standardized neuron-enriched culture, lacking 
      glia. We compared fibril treatment of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 germ-line 
      knock-out, and G2019S germ-line knock-in, mouse cortical neuron cultures with those 
      from littermates. We found leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 knock-out neurons are 
      resistant to α-synuclein aggregation, which predominantly forms within axons, and 
      may cause axonal fragmentation. Conversely, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 knock-in 
      neurons are more vulnerable to fibril-induced α-synuclein accumulation. Protection 
      and resistance correlated with basal increases in a lysosome marker in knock-out, 
      and an autophagy marker in knock-in cultures. The data add to a growing number of 
      studies that argue leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 silencing, and potentially kinase 
      inhibition, may be a useful therapeutic strategy against synucleinopathy.

      standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A to D, with A 
      having the strongest evidence base (from randomized controlled trials) and D the 
      weakest (case studies or expert opinion). Current clinical diagnostic criteria for 
      dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and brain 
      imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, 
      rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for mild to moderate Alzheimer's 
      disease (A) and memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (A). Until 
      further evidence is available other drugs, including statins, anti-inflammatory 
      drugs, vitamin E and Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment 
      or prevention of Alzheimer's disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor 
      memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase 
      inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), 
      though selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not 
      cognitive) features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment 
      of people with Lewy body dementias (Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with 
      Lewy bodies (DLB)), especially for neuropsychiatric symptoms (A). Cholinesterase 
      inhibitors and memantine can produce cognitive improvements in DLB (A). There is no 
      clear evidence that any intervention can prevent or delay the onset of dementia. 
      Although the consensus statement focuses on medication, psychological interventions 
      can be effective in addition to pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and 
      non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel pharmacological approaches involving strategies 
      to reduce amyloid and/or tau deposition are in progress. Although results of pivotal 
      studies are awaited, results to date have been equivocal and no disease-modifying 
      agents are either licensed or can be currently recommended for clinical use.

TI  - A Mouse Model of Nigrostriatal Dopaminergic Axonal Degeneration As a Tool for 
      Testing Neuroprotectors.
PG  - 110-113
LID - 10.32607/actanaturae.11433 [doi]
AB  - Degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease begins 
      from the axonal terminals in the striatum and, then, in retrograde fashion, 
      progresses to the cell bodies in the substantia nigra. Investigation of the dynamics 
      of axonal terminal degeneration may help in the identification of new targets for 
      neuroprotective treatment and be used as a tool for testing potential drugs. We have 
      shown that the degeneration rate of dopaminergic axonal terminals changes over time, 
      and that the striatal dopamine concentration is the most sensitive parameter to the 
      action of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). This model was 
      validated using neuroprotectors with well-known mechanisms of action: the dopamine 
      transporter inhibitor nomifensine and SEMAX peptide that stimulates the secretion of 
      endogenous neurotrophic factors or acts as an antioxidant. Nomifensine was shown to 
      almost completely protect dopaminergic fibers from the toxic effect of MPTP and 
      maintain the striatal dopamine concentration at the control level. However, SEMAX, 
      slightly but reliably, increased striatal dopamine when administered before MPTP 
      treatment, which indicates that it is more effective as an inductor of endogenous 
      neurotrophic factor secretion rather than as an antioxidant.

TI  - Structural Features and Toxicity of α-Synuclein Oligomers Grown in the Presence of 
      DOPAC.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22116008 [doi]
LID - 6008
AB  - The interplay between α-synuclein and dopamine derivatives is associated with 
      oxidative stress-dependent neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). The 
      formation in the dopaminergic neurons of intraneuronal inclusions containing 
      aggregates of α-synuclein is a typical hallmark of PD. Even though the biochemical 
      events underlying the aberrant aggregation of α-synuclein are not completely 
      understood, strong evidence correlates this process with the levels of dopamine 
      metabolites. In vitro, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) and the other two 
      metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol 
      (DOPET), share the property to inhibit the growth of mature amyloid fibrils of 
      α-synuclein. Although this effect occurs with the formation of differently toxic 
      products, the molecular basis of this inhibition is still unclear. Here, we provide 
      information on the effect of DOPAC on the aggregation properties of α-synuclein and 
      its ability to interact with membranes. DOPAC inhibits α-synuclein aggregation, 
      stabilizing monomer and inducing the formation of dimers and trimers. DOPAC-induced 
      oligomers did not undergo conformational transition in the presence of membranes, 
      and penetrated the cell, where they triggered autophagic processes. Cellular assays 
      showed that DOPAC reduced cytotoxicity and ROS production induced by α-synuclein 
      aggregates. Our findings show that the early radicals resulting from DOPAC 
      autoxidation produced covalent modifications of the protein, which were not by 
      themselves a primary cause of either fibrillation or membrane binding inhibition. 
      These findings are discussed in the light of the potential mechanism of DOPAC 
      protection against the toxicity of α-synuclein aggregates to better understand 
      protein and catecholamine biology and to eventually suggest a scaffold that can help 
      in the design of candidate molecules able to interfere in α-synuclein aggregation.

TI  - Treatment of Apathy in Huntington's Disease and Other Movement Disorders.
PG  - 508-19
LID - 10.1007/s11940-011-0140-y [doi]
AB  - Apathy is one of the most prevalent neurobehavioral symptoms in Huntington's disease 
      (HD), occurring in approximately 70% of the symptomatic HD population. Apathy scores 
      in patients with HD are highly correlated with duration of illness, suggesting that 
      apathy is an inevitable consequence of advanced disease. Although less distressing 
      than symptoms like depression and less disruptive than irritability or aggression, 
      apathy has a considerable adverse impact on those affected with HD because it leads 
      to a decrease of the goal-directed behaviors that contribute much to the day-to-day 
      quality of life. As a neuropsychiatric syndrome, apathy is also common in patients 
      with other neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain 
      injury, cerebrovascular accident, dementia, and other neurodegenerative conditions. 
      The nosologic status of apathy and lack of a clear definition has probably 
      contributed to the paucity of therapeutic evidence in this area. Several different 
      scales are available to measure apathy, including the Apathy Evaluation Scale, 
      Apathy Inventory, Lilles Apathy Rating Scale, and the apathy items from the Unified 
      HD Rating Scale, the Problem Behaviours Assessment for HD, and the Neuropsychiatric 
      Inventory, but all are based on slightly different definitions of apathy, so the 
      scores obtained may not be directly comparable. Assessment may also be complicated 
      by overlap between the manifestations of apathy and other complications of HD such 
      as depression, so the identification and treatment of these comorbid conditions is 
      important. No adequate evidence currently supports any specific pharmacologic or 
      psychological intervention for apathy in HD. Evidence can only be extrapolated from 
      interventional studies done in other basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's 
      disease or other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia. The neurobiology of 
      apathy points towards three areas of functional connectivity: connections between 
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basal ganglia, orbitomedial PFC and 
      basal ganglia, and dorsomedial PFC and basal ganglia. Pharmacologic interventions 
      such as cholinesterase inhibitors, the dopaminergic antidepressant bupropion, 
      amantadine, levodopa, bromocriptine, methylphenidate, and atypical antipsychotics 
      have all been tried in other neurodegenerative disorders, but not in HD. 
      Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive stimulation therapy and multisensory 
      stimulation, which have been used in patients with dementia, have not been properly 
      studied in HD. Individualized treatment should be considered, using a combination of 
      methods, as there is no evidence to support one particular type of treatment. 
      Multidisciplinary input, environmental modifications, improved psychosocial support, 
      and psychoeducation programs designed to help caregivers to understand and 
      compensate for the deficits caused by this symptom may all have a role to play in 
      the treatment of apathy.

TI  - Essential tremor-the most common movement disorder in older people.
PG  - 344-9
AB  - Essential tremor (ET) affects approximately 4% of the population above 65 years of 
      age. The traditional view that ET is a familial monosymptomatic disorder with a 
      benign prognosis has recently been challenged, as it is now known to be a 
      progressive and clinically heterogeneous condition with sporadic and familial forms. 
      The pathogenesis of ET is not fully understood, though a disordered central 
      mechanism is the most likely site of origin with possible modulation by muscle 
      adrenoreceptors. The limited post-mortem studies have not shown consistent 
      abnormalities in the brains of ET patients. ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's 
      disease, particularly in the older population. Tremor amplitude increases with age, 
      accounting for substantial disability in older people. Current therapy (drugs and 
      neurosurgery) has significant limitations in older people. A better understanding of 
      its pathophysiology in the future will help in developing more effective therapy, 
      including neuroprotective strategies.

TI  - Lig-8, a highly bioactive lignophenol derivative from bamboo lignin, exhibits 
      multifaceted neuroprotective activity.
PG  - 296-307
AB  - Lignin is a durable aromatic network polymer that is second only to cellulose in 
      natural abundance. Lig-8, a lignophenol derivative from bamboo lignin, is a highly 
      potent neuroprotectant. It protects human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) from 
      hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis by preventing caspase-3 activation via 
      either caspase-8 or caspase-9. It exerts this antiapoptotic effect by protecting 
      mitochondrial membrane permeability from damage by H2O2 or the peripheral 
      benzodiazepine receptor ligand PK11195. Lig-8 has been also shown to scavenge the 
      reactive oxygen or nitrogen species in vitro. Furthermore, lig-8 suppresses 
      apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation, tunicamycin (endoplasmic reticulum 
      [ER]-stress inducer), or proteasome inhibitor in pheochromocytoma cells. In 
      addition, in vivo, lig-8 reduced intravitreal N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced retinal 
      damage (decreases in retinal ganglion cells and inner plexiform layer thickness) in 
      mice. Lig-8 prevents neuronal damage partly by inhibiting excessive endoplasmic 
      reticulum stress. In this article, we review the protective effects of lig-8 against 
      apoptosis induced by various stimuli. Apoptosis is an active, energy-dependent 
      process through which living cells initiate their own death. It can be induced by a 
      variety of physiological and pharmacological stimuli. Apoptotic cell death is 
      associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, or 
      Huntington disease as well as glaucoma. We believe that the elucidation of the 
      mechanism of antiapoptotic action of lig-8 may help in finding new approaches to the 
      treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) impact the pathological aggregation of 
      α-synuclein (αS), a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we synthesize αS 
      phosphorylated at tyrosine 39 (pY(39)) through a novel route using in vitro 
      enzymatic phosphorylation of a fragment followed by ligation to form the full-length 
      protein. We can execute this synthesis in combination with unnatural amino acid 
      mutagenesis to include two fluorescent labels for Förster resonance energy transfer 
      (FRET) studies. We determine the effect of pY(39) on the aggregation of αS and 
      compare our authentically phosphorylated material to the corresponding glutamate 39 
      "phosphomimetic." Intriguingly, we find that αS-pY(39) can either accelerate or 
      decelerate aggregation, depending on the fraction of phosphorylated protein. The 
      αS-E(39) mutant can qualitatively reproduce some, but not all, of these effects. 
      FRET measurements and analysis of existing structures of αS help to provide an 
      explanation for this phenomenon. Our results have important implications for the 
      treatment of PD patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and highlight the 
      importance of validating phosphomimetics through studies of authentic PTMs.

AB  - In advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, continuous intra-duodenal infusion of 
      levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an established approach in the 
      management of motor complications that cannot be further improved by conventional 
      oral therapy. In general, tolerability of LCIG has resembled that of oral 
      dopaminergic therapy; however, cases of symptomatic peripheral neuropathy (PN), 
      sometimes severe, have been reported in patients receiving LCIG. Cases are generally 
      a sensorimotor polyneuropathy with both subacute and chronic onsets, often 
      associated with vitamin B12 and/or B6 deficiency. Rare cases clinically resemble 
      Guillain-Barré syndrome. In the absence of prospectively collected data on possible 
      associations between LCIG and PN, it is prudent to explore potential mechanisms that 
      may explain a possible relationship. The PN may be linked to use of high-dose 
      levodopa, promoting high levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid or reduced 
      absorption of vitamins essential for homocysteine metabolism. Cases of 
      LCIG-associated PN often have responded to vitamin supplementation without need for 
      LCIG cessation, although LCIG cessation is sometimes necessary. It may be advisable 
      to monitor vitamin B12/B6 status before and after patients start LCIG and be 
      vigilant for signs of PN. Prospective, large-scale, long-term studies are needed to 
      clarify whether vitamin supplementation and routine use of a 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor may help prevent PN in LCIG recipients and 
      whether these measures should be routine practice in patients with PD on high-dose 
      oral levodopa.

      Signaling Pathway Inhibits Cell Apoptosis in Parkinson's Disease.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable progressive disorder resulting from 
      neurodegeneration, and apoptosis is considered a dominant mechanism underlying the 
      process of neurodegeneration. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small and noncoding RNAs 
      involved in many a biological process like apoptosis and regulation of gene 
      expressions, have been found in postmortem brain samples of patients with PD, as 
      well as in vitro and in vivo models of PD. To explore the impact of miR-15b-5p and 
      Akt3 on apoptosis in the progression of PD, the method of quantitative reverse 
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed, and the analysis 
      result showed upregulated expression of miR-15b-5p and downregulated expression of 
      Akt3 in the serum of PD patients, MPP(+)-induced SH-SY5Y cells, and the brain 
      tissues of MPTP-induced mice. Meanwhile, the dual-luciferase reporter assay was used 
      to demonstrate the regulator-target interaction between miR-15b-5p and Akt3; flow 
      cytometry and spectrophotometry revealed that transfection of miR-15b-5p mimic and 
      si-Akt3 increased the rate of apoptosis and caspase-3 activity, whereas transfecting 
      the miR-15b-5p inhibitor and Akt3-overexpression plasmid repressed the rate of 
      apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in the MPP(+)-induced SH-SY5Y cell model and the 
      MPTP-induced mouse model. Additionally, analysis of western blotting (WB) assays in 
      vivo and in vitro revealed that proapoptosis proteins (Bax, caspase-3, GSK-3β, and 
      β-catenin) showed markedly upregulated expression in the miR-15b-5p inhibitor and 
      si-Akt3-overexpression groups, while the expression of an antiapoptosis gene (i.e., 
      Bcl2) was downregulated. These analysis results indicate that downregulation of 
      miR-15b-5p by targeting the Akt3-mediated GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway would 
      repress cell apoptosis in PD in vivo and in vitro. It is expected that the research 
      findings would help find new therapeutic targets for treatment of PD.

TI  - Allosteric modulators of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors: molecular mechanisms and 
      therapeutic potential.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ion channels gated by glutamate, the 
      major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). 
      They are widespread in the CNS and are involved in numerous physiological and 
      pathological processes including synaptic plasticity, chronic pain and psychosis. 
      Aberrant NMDAR activity also plays an important role in the neuronal loss associated 
      with ischaemic insults and major degenerative disorders including Parkinson's and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Agents that target and alter NMDAR function may, thus, have 
      therapeutic benefit. Interestingly, NMDARs are endowed with multiple extracellular 
      regulatory sites that recognize ions or small molecule ligands, some of which are 
      likely to regulate receptor function in vivo. These allosteric sites, which differ 
      from agonist-binding and channel-permeation sites, provide means to modulate, either 
      positively or negatively, NMDAR activity. The present review focuses on allosteric 
      modulation of NMDARs containing the NR2B subunit. Indeed, the NR2B subunit confers a 
      particularly rich pharmacology with distinct recognition sites for exogenous and 
      endogenous allosteric ligands. Moreover, NR2B-containing receptors, compared with 
      other NMDAR subtypes, appear to contribute preferentially to pathological processes 
      linked to overexcitation of glutamatergic pathways. The actions of extracellular H+, 
      Mg2+, Zn2+, of polyamines and neurosteroids, and of the synthetic compounds 
      ifenprodil and derivatives ('prodils') are presented. Particular emphasis is put 
      upon the structural determinants and molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects 
      exerted by these agents. A better understanding of how NR2B-containing NMDARs (and 
      NMDARs in general) operate and how they can be modulated should help define new 
      strategies to counteract the deleterious effects of dysregulated NMDAR activity.

TI  - Vitamin B12 inhibits α-synuclein fibrillogenesis and protects against 
      amyloid-induced cytotoxicity.
PG  - 2861-2870
LID - 10.1039/c8fo02471e [doi]
AB  - Vitamin B12 (VB12) is a necessary micronutrient for growth and the development of 
      the nervous system. Severe deficiencies of VB12 have been linked to damage of 
      learning and memory ability and cognitive decline, along with several neurological 
      diseases. Misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein (αSN) into insoluble fibrils is 
      associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), which affects 
      tens of millions of elderly patients all over the world. Developing novel inhibitors 
      to obstruct the aggregation of αSN has become a topic of intense research. In this 
      study, the inhibitory effect of VB12 against the fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity of 
      αSN was systematically analyzed using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, atomic force 
      microscopy (AFM), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cytotoxicity assays. Both 
      ThT and AFM results showed that VB12 could inhibit αSN fibrillogenesis in a 
      dose-dependent manner. CD data suggested that VB12 delays the conformational 
      conversion of αSN to β-sheet rich structures, especially to the parallel β-sheet 
      conformation. As a result, VB12 greatly alleviated the cytotoxicity of αSN 
      aggregates. Moreover, VB12 was also found to disassemble preexisting mature αSN 
      fibrils and attenuate the consequent cytotoxicity. These findings not only provide a 
      comprehensive understanding of the inhibitory effect of VB12 on αSN fibrillogenesis, 
      but also identify a valuable nutrient source that possesses great potential to be 
      developed as a new functional food ingredient to help alleviate PD.

AB  - We discuss the participation of mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy in the 
      6-hydroxidopamine-induced Parkinson's disease model. The regulation of dynamic 
      mitochondrial processes such as fusion, fission, and mitophagy has been shown to be 
      an important mechanism controlling cellular fate. An imbalance in mitochondrial 
      dynamics may contribute to both familial and sporadic neurodegenerative diseases 
      including Parkinson's disease. With special attention we address the role of second 
      messengers as the role of reactive oxygen species and the mitochondria as the 
      headquarters of cell death. The role of molecular signaling pathways, for instance, 
      the participation of Dynamin-related protein 1(Drp1), will also be addressed. 
      Furthermore evidence demonstrates the therapeutic potential of small-molecule 
      inhibitors of mitochondrial division in Parkinson's disease. For instance, 
      pharmacological inhibition of Drp1, through treatment with the mitochondrial 
      division inhibitor-1, results in the abrogation of mitochondrial fission and in a 
      decrease of the number of autophagic cells. Deciphering the signaling cascades that 
      underlie mitophagy triggered by 6-OHDA, as well as the mechanisms that determine the 
      selectivity of this response, will help to better understand this process and may 
      have impact on human treatment strategies of Parkinson's disease.

TI  - DL‑3‑n‑butylphthalide reduces microglial activation in lipopolysaccharide‑induced

AB  - As microglial activation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease 
      (PD), drugs that target this process may help to prevent or delay the development of 
      PD. The present study investigated the effects of dl‑3‑n‑butylphthalide (NBP) on 
      microglia in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PD mouse model. The mice were 
      randomly divided into a blank control group, LPS control group and NBP + LPS 
      treatment group. Mice in the treatment group were given an intragastric infusion of 
      120 mg/kg NBP daily for 30 days during the establishment of the PD mouse model. At 4 
      and 28 weeks post‑treatment, the motor behaviours of the mice in each group were 
      observed using the rotarod test and the open field test. In addition, 
      immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine the levels of activated 
      microglia, tumour necrosis factor‑α and α‑synuclein, and the number of tyrosine 
      hydroxylase (TH)‑positive cells in the substantia nigra. NBP significantly improved 
      dyskinesia, reduced microglial activation, decreased nuclear α‑synuclein deposition 
      and increased the survival of TH‑positive cells in the substantia nigra of 
      LPS‑induced PD model mice. These findings suggested that NBP may exert its 
      therapeutic effect by reducing microglial activation in a mouse model of PD.

TI  - The discovery of a highly selective 
      5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one SIRT2 inhibitor that is 
      neuroprotective in an in vitro Parkinson's disease model.
PG  - 69-82
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.201402431 [doi]
AB  - Sirtuins, NAD(+) -dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs), have recently emerged as 
      potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases. The 
      discovery of potent and isoform-selective inhibitors of this enzyme family should 
      provide chemical tools to help determine the roles of these targets and validate 
      their therapeutic value. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel class of highly 
      selective SIRT2 inhibitors, identified by pharmacophore screening. We report the 
      identification and validation of 
      3-((2-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)methyl)-7-((pyridin-3-ylmethyl)amino)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one 
      (ICL-SIRT078), a substrate-competitive SIRT2 inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.62 ± 
      0.15 μM and more than 50-fold selectivity against SIRT1, 3 and 5. Treatment of MCF-7 
      breast cancer cells with ICL-SIRT078 results in hyperacetylation of α-tubulin, an 
      established SIRT2 biomarker, at doses comparable with the biochemical IC50 data, 
      while suppressing MCF-7 proliferation at higher concentrations. In concordance with 
      the recent reports that suggest SIRT2 inhibition is a potential strategy for the 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease, we find that compound ICL-SIRT078 has a 
      significant neuroprotective effect in a lactacystin-induced model of Parkinsonian 
      neuronal cell death in the N27 cell line. These results encourage further 
      investigation into the effects of ICL-SIRT078, or an optimised derivative thereof, 
      as a candidate neuroprotective agent in in vivo models of Parkinson's disease.

TI  - The chemical biology of clinically tolerated NMDA receptor antagonists.
PG  - 1611-26
AB  - Most neuroprotective drugs have failed in clinical trials because of side-effects, 
      causing normal brain function to become compromised. A case in point concerns 
      antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate type of glutamate receptor (NMDAR). 
      Glutamate receptors are essential to the normal function of the central nervous 
      system. However, their excessive activation by excitatory amino acids, such as 
      glutamate itself, is thought to contribute to neuronal damage in many neurological 
      disorders ranging from acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury to chronic 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
      Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The dual role of NMDARs in 
      particular for normal and abnormal functioning of the nervous system imposes 
      important constraints on possible therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating 
      neurological diseases. Blockade of excessive NMDAR activity must therefore be 
      achieved without interference with its normal function. In general, NMDAR 
      antagonists can be categorized pharmacologically according to the site of action on 
      the receptor-channel complex. These include drugs acting at the agonist (NMDA) or 
      co-agonist (glycine) sites, channel pore, and modulatory sites, such as the 
      S-nitrosylation site where nitric oxide (NO) reacts with critical cysteine thiol 
      groups. Because glutamate is thought to be the major excitatory transmitter in the 
      brain, generalized inhibition of a glutamate receptor subtype like the NMDAR causes 
      side-effects that clearly limit the potential for clinical applications. Both 
      competitive NMDA and glycine antagonists, even although effective in preventing 
      glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity, will cause generalized inhibition of NMDAR 
      activities and thus have failed in many clinical trials. Open-channel block with the 
      property of uncompetitive antagonism is the most appealing strategy for therapeutic 
      intervention during excessive NMDAR activation as this action of blockade requires 
      prior activation of the receptor. This property, in theory, leads to a higher degree 
      of channel blockade in the presence of excessive levels of glutamate and little 
      blockade at relatively lower levels, for example, during physiological 
      neurotransmission. Utilizing this molecular strategy of action, we review here the 
      logical process that we applied over the past decade to help develop memantine as 
      the first clinically tolerated yet effective agent against NMDAR-mediated 
      neurotoxicity. Phase 3 (final) clinical trials have shown that memantine is 
      effective in treating moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease while being well 
      tolerated. Memantine is also currently in trials for additional neurological 
      disorders, including other forms of dementia, glaucoma, and severe neuropathic pain. 
      Additionally, taking advantage of memantine's preferential binding to open channels 
      and the fact that excessive NMDAR activity can be down-regulated by S-nitrosylation, 
      we have recently developed combinatorial drugs called NitroMemantines. These drugs 
      use memantine as a homing signal to target NO to hyperactivated NMDARs in order to 
      avoid systemic side-effects of NO such as hypotension (low blood pressure). These 
      second-generation memantine derivatives are designed as pathologically activated 
      therapeutics, and in preliminary studies appear to have even greater neuroprotective 
      properties than memantine.

TI  - DopAmide: Novel, Water-Soluble, Slow-Release l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) 
      Precursor Moderates l-DOPA Conversion to Dopamine and Generates a Sustained Level of 
      Dopamine at Dopaminergic Neurons.
PG  - 461-7
LID - 10.1111/cns.12518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) treatment of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) is associated with motor complications known as l-DOPA-induced 
      dyskinesias (LID) and on/off fluctuations, which are linked to unsteady pulsatile 
      dopaminergic stimulation. AIM: The objective of this study was to improve l-DOPA 
      treatment by slowing and stabilizing dopamine (DA) production in the brain and 
      increasing water solubility to provide a rescue therapy for PD. RESULTS: We 
      synthesized l-DOPA-amide, a novel l-DOPA precursor called DopAmide. DopAmide is 
      water soluble and, as a prodrug, requires hydrolysis prior to decarboxylation by the 
      aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28; AAAD). In the 6-OH-dopamine 
      (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats, DopAmide maintained steady rotations for up to 4 h compared 
      with 2 h by l-DOPA, suggesting that this rate-limiting step generated a sustained 
      level of DA at dopaminergic neurons. Pharmacokinetic studies showed elimination 
      half-life of l-DOPA in the plasma after DopAmide treatment of t1/2 = 4.1 h, 
      significantly longer than t1/2 = 2.9 h after treatment with l-DOPA, consistent with 
      the 6-OHDA results. CONCLUSIONS: The slow conversion of DopAmide to l-DOPA provides 
      a sustained level of DA in the dopaminergic cells, shown by the long 6-OHDA steady 
      rotations. The water solubility and improved bioavailability may help reduce 
      medication frequency associated with l-DOPA treatment of PD. Sustained levels of DA 
      might lower the super-sensitization of DA signaling and potentially attenuate l-DOPA 
      adverse effects.

TI  - Targeting tachykinins for the treatment of obstructive airways disease.
PG  - 201-16
AB  - The tachykinin family of peptides are distributed throughout the nervous system and 
      are thought to play a critical role in inflammation and immunomodulation. 
      Tachykinins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disease 
      processes including inflammatory pain, emesis, depression, Parkinson's disease and 
      inflammatory bowel syndrome. In the airways of animals, substance P and neurokinin A 
      are released from a subset of airway sensory nerves, and evoke vasodilatation, 
      bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, leukocyte recruitment, airways hyperreactivity 
      and cough. These observations have led to suggestions that tachykinins may also be 
      viable targets for the treatment of obstructive airways disease. Clinical trials in 
      humans assessing the utility of tachykinin receptor antagonists such as nepadutant 
      and saredutant for the treatment of asthma are limited, and the results for the most 
      part have been inconclusive. Several new tachykinin receptor antagonists have been 
      recently designed to target multiple tachykinin receptor subtypes and to readily 
      penetrate into the central nervous system. Future clinical trials with these 
      compounds should help to shed some light on the role of tachykinins in obstructive 
      airways disease.

      Parkinson's: A delphi study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls are common in Parkinson's disease so any intervention that reduced 
      falls risk would be of value. One potential intervention is the use of 
      cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEi) drugs. OBJECTIVE: To establish the minimum 
      clinically important difference (MCID) for fall rates to inform the effect estimate 
      for sample size calculations of future clinical trials. METHODS: We performed a 
      Delphi study assembling a panel of experts in Parkinson's disease from academic and 
      clinical medicine in order to reach a consensus of opinion. Responses from a panel 
      were summarised and resent to the group, until consensus was reached. RESULTS: 780 
      clinicians, who had been caring for people with Parkinson's for an average of 14 
      years, were contacted via three routes. The median (Interquartile range (IQR)) MCID 
      after round 1 was 25% (IQR 20-30%) which equates to the prevention of 5 (IQR 4-6) 
      falls per year. Increasing consensus after round two confirmed the MCID of 25%, 
      narrowing the (IQ) range to 20%-25%. This was unchanged when the panel were shown 
      the number of participants that would need to be recruited to a clinical trial in 
      order to achieve this difference. CONCLUSIONS: We have established that an expert 
      panel of PD specialists consider that an intervention that demonstrated a 25% (IQR 
      20-25%) relative reduction in falls rate would be clinically meaningful. This 
      estimate can be used to help determine the sample size for any future clinical 
      trial.

TI  - Chronic treatment with the mGlu5R antagonist MPEP reduces the functional effects of 
      the mGlu5R agonist CHPG in the striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats: possible 
      relevance to the effects of mGlu5R blockade in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 646-54
AB  - This study was designed to test whether chronic treatment with the metabotropic 
      glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5R) antagonist MPEP showed antiparkinsonian effects in 
      rats unilaterally lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (a "classic" model of 
      Parkinson's disease, PD), and to evaluate whether chronic MPEP influenced the 
      functional properties and/or the expression of striatal mGlu5Rs. Wistar rats were 
      lesioned with 6-OHDA and then treated with MPEP (3 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or its vehicle 
      over 2 weeks. Chronic MPEP did not induce measurable antiparkinsonian effects, since 
      no differences were found between MPEP- and vehicle-treated animals in the pattern 
      of L-DOPA-induced contralateral rotations. In corticostriatal slices taken from 
      animals chronically treated with MPEP, the functional effects of the mGlu5R agonist 
      CHPG were significantly reduced in the lesioned vs. the intact side, while no 
      changes were found in slices taken from vehicle-treated rats. The binding of 
      [3H]MPEP to striatal membranes showed that neither the maximal number of binding 
      sites (Bmax) nor the dissociation constant (Kd) were changed by the lesion and/or by 
      chronic MPEP. While chronic MPEP did not potentiate L-DOPA-induced turning in a 
      classical model of PD, its ability to reduce mGlu5R-associated signal could help to 
      explain the neuroprotective/antiparkinsonian effects observed in other models of PD.

AB  - Glutamate, a major neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of human, plays a 
      crucial role in various neurological pathways by activating the ligand-gated ion 
      channels such as mGluR and iGluR. Dysfunction of mGluR 5 can cause Alzheimer's 
      disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression, anxiety, etc. In the current 
      study, we have developed the energetically optimized pharmacophore model to screen 
      the eMolecules database having more than 6 million compounds with the help of 
      reported cocrystal structure with 
      3-chloro-5-[6-(5-fluoropyridin-2 yl)pyrimidin-4-yl]benzonitrile (PDB ID: 5CGD). The 
      obtained hits were docked into the allosteric site of the target and further 
      validation of E-pharmacophore was done by enrichment calculations followed by the 
      molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the specific amino acid interactions with 
      the compound present in the allosteric site of the receptor.

AB  - It has been reported that many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are abnormally expressed 
      in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the knowledge about the role of dysregulated 
      lncRNA in the pathological process of PD and the potential molecular regulation 
      mechanism is still limited. Our immunofluorescence data show that miR-126 enhances 
      the aggregation and toxicity of synuclein, while lncRNA OIP5-AS1 reduces the 
      aggregation and toxicity of MPP + induced α-synuclein by targeting miR-126. 
      Luciferase experiments have found that miR-126 regulates α-synuclein by targeting 
      PLK2. Western blot and IP experimental analysis showed that this process is achieved 
      by regulating PLK2/α-synuclein autophagy. In conclusion, our data indicate that 
      OIP5-AS1 promotes the autophagy of PLK2-α-synuclein by targeting the miR-126 axis 
      with pathogenic factors, thus reducing the aggregation toxicity of α-synuclein, 
      which It will help better to understand the mechanism of dopaminergic neuron loss in 
      PD and provide novel treatment options.

TI  - What is it that l-deprenyl (selegiline) might do?
PG  - 781-96
AB  - There have been many claims that l-deprenyl may have distinct properties in slowing 
      and perhaps even in reversing the progression of Parkinson's disease and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions. This article will consider the paucity of evidence 
      that such is the case in humans and the more detailed results from studies with 
      experimental animals indicating that deprenyl may indeed express such a property. 
      The conflicting data on its mechanism of action are considered and the concept that 
      it may function to enhance neuronal fitness is advanced as an alternative to the 
      neuroprotection and neurorescue hypotheses. Possible lines of experimental 
      development that would help resolve some of the many unanswered questions regarding 
      l-deprenyl function are outlined.

TI  - The role of neuronal nitric oxide and its pathways in the protection and recovery 
      from neurotoxin-induced de novo hypokinetic motor behaviors in the embryonic 
      zebrafish (Danio rerio).

AB  - Neuronal nitric oxide (nNO) has been shown to affect motor function in the brain. 
      Specifically, nNO acts in part through regulation of dopamine (DA) release, 
      transporter function, and the elicitation of neuroprotection/neurodegeneration of 
      neurons in conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the zebrafish has 
      been proposed to be a new model for the study of PD since neurotoxin damage to their 
      nigrostriatal-like neurons exhibit PD-like motor dysfunctions similar to those of 
      mammalian models and human patients. Results from this study demonstrate that 
      treatment of 5 days post fertilization (dpf) fish with a nNO synthase inhibitor as a 
      co-treatment with 6-OHDA facilitates long-term survival and accelerates the recovery 
      from 6-OHDA-induced hypokinesia-like symptoms. These findings are unique in that 
      under conditions of neurotoxin-induced stress, the inhibition of the NO-related 
      S-nitrosylation indirect pathway dramatically facilitates recovery from 6-OHDA 
      treatment but inhibition of the NO-sGC-cGMP direct pathway is essential for survival 
      in 5 dpf treated fish. In conclusion, these results indicate that nNOS and the 
      inhibition of the NO-linked S-nitrosylation pathway plays an important role in 
      antagonizing the protection and recovery of fish from neurotoxin treatment. These 
      data begin to help in the understanding of the role of NO as a neuroprotectant in 
      dopaminergic pathways, particularly those that influence motor dysfunctions.

TI  - An in silico analysis of the binding modes and binding affinities of small molecule 
      modulators of PDZ-peptide interactions.

AB  - Inhibitors of PDZ-peptide interactions have important implications in a variety of 
      biological processes including treatment of cancer and Parkinson's disease. Even 
      though experimental studies have reported characterization of peptidomimetic 
      inhibitors of PDZ-peptide interactions, the binding modes for most of them have not 
      been characterized by structural studies. In this study we have attempted to 
      understand the structural basis of the small molecule-PDZ interactions by in silico 
      analysis of the binding modes and binding affinities of a set of 38 small molecules 
      with known K(i) or K(d) values for PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains of PSD-95 protein. These 
      two PDZ domains show differential selectivity for these compounds despite having a 
      high degree of sequence similarity and almost identical peptide binding pockets. 
      Optimum binding modes for these ligands for PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains were identified by 
      using a novel combination of semi-flexible docking and explicit solvent molecular 
      dynamics (MD) simulations. Analysis of the binding modes revealed most of the 
      peptidomimectic ligands which had high K(i) or K(d) moved away from the peptide 
      binding pocket, while ligands with high binding affinities remained in the peptide 
      binding pocket. The differential specificities of the PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains 
      primarily arise from differences in the conformation of the loop connecting βB and 
      βC strands, because this loop interacts with the N-terminal chemical moieties of the 
      ligands. We have also computed the MM/PBSA binding free energy values for these 38 
      compounds with both the PDZ domains from multiple 5 ns MD trajectories on each 
      complex i.e. a total of 228 MD trajectories of 5 ns length each. Interestingly, 
      computational binding free energies show good agreement with experimental binding 
      free energies with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.6. Thus our study 
      demonstrates that combined use of docking and MD simulations can help in 
      identification of potent inhibitors of PDZ-peptide complexes.

TI  - Excitotoxicity, synaptic repair, and functional recovery in the mammalian cochlea: a 
      review of recent findings.
PG  - 249-54
AB  - Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic 
      properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This 
      so-called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms 
      of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal 
      ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: 
      anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two-step mechanism: (1) An acute 
      swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together 
      with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) 
      resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be 
      observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. 
      (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or 
      repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry 
      of Ca2+, which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments 
      in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the 
      development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and 
      reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral 
      ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy 
      against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in 
      ischemic- or noise-induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.

AB  - Increased β-synuclein (Sncb) expression has been described in the aging visual 
      system. Sncb functions as the physiological antagonist of α-synuclein (Snca), which 
      is involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's 
      and Alzheimer's diseases. However, the exact function of Sncb remains unknown. The 
      aim of this study was to elucidate the age-dependent role of Sncb in brain 
      microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). BMECs were isolated from the cortices of 5- 
      to 9-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats and were cultured with different concentrations of 
      recombinant Sncb (rSncb) up to 72 h resembling to some degree age-related as well as 
      pathophysiological conditions. Viability, apoptosis, expression levels of Snca, and 
      the members of phospholipase D2 (Pld2)/ p53/ Mouse double minute 2 homolog 
      (Mdm2)/p19(Arf) pathway, response in RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase 
      (Akt), and stress-mediating factors such as heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (Hmox) and 
      Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxygenase 4 (Nox4) were examined. 
      rSncb-induced effects were confirmed through Sncb small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
      knockdown in BMECs. We demonstrated that the viability decreases, while the rate of 
      apoptosis underly dose-dependent alterations. For example, apoptosis increases in 
      BMECs following the treatment with higher dosed rSncb. Furthermore, we observed a 
      decrease in Snca immunostaining and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels following the 
      exposure to higher rScnb concentrations. Akt was shown to be downregulated and pAkt 
      upregulated by this treatment, which was accompanied by a dose-independent increase 
      in p19(Arf) levels and enhanced intracellular Mdm2 translocation in contrast to a 
      dose-dependent p53 activation. Moreover, Pld2 activity was shown to be induced in 
      rSncb-treated BMECs. The expression of Hmox and Nox4 after Sncb treatment was 
      altered on BEMCs. The obtained results demonstrate dose-dependent effects of Sncb on 
      BMECs in vitro. For example, the p53-mediated and Akt-independent apoptosis together 
      with the stress-mediated response of BMECs related to exposure of higher SNCB 
      concentrations may reflect the increase in Sncb with duration of culture as well as 
      its impact on cell decay. Further studies, expanding on the role of Sncb, may help 
      understand its role in the neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) is expressed in the mitochondrial membrane and has a key 
      role in degrading various neurologically active amines such as benzylamine, 
      phenethylamine and dopamine with the help of Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) 
      cofactor. The Parkinson's disease associated symptoms can be treated using 
      inhibitors of MAO-B as the dopamine degradation can be reduced. Currently, many 
      inhibitors are available having micromolar to nanomolar binding affinities. However, 
      still there is demand for compounds with superior binding affinity and binding 
      specificity with favorable pharmacokinetic properties for treating Parkinson's 
      disease and computational screening methods can be majorly recruited for this. 
      However, the accuracy of currently available force-field methods for ranking the 
      inhibitors or lead drug-like compounds should be improved and novel methods for 
      screening compounds need to be developed. We studied the performance of various 
      force-field-based methods and data driven approaches in ranking about 3753 compounds 
      having activity against the MAO-B target. The binding affinities computed using 
      autodock and autodock-vina are shown to be non-reliable. The force-field-based 
      MM-GBSA also under-performs. However, certain machine learning approaches, in 
      particular KNN, are found to be superior, and we propose KNN as the most reliable 
      approach for ranking the complexes to reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, all the 
      employed machine learning approaches are also computationally less demanding.

AB  - Mutations that activate the LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) protein 
      kinase predispose to Parkinson's disease, suggesting that LRRK2 inhibitors might 
      have therapeutic benefit. Recent work has revealed that LRRK2 phosphorylates a 
      subgroup of 14 Rab proteins, including Rab10, at a specific residue located at the 
      centre of its effector-binding switch-II motif. In the present study, we analyse the 
      selectivity and sensitivity of polyclonal and monoclonal phospho-specific antibodies 
      raised against nine different LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab proteins (Rab3A/3B/3C/3D, 
      Rab5A/5B/5C, Rab8A/8B, Rab10, Rab12, Rab29[T71], Rab29[S72], Rab35 and Rab43). We 
      identify rabbit monoclonal phospho-specific antibodies (MJFF-pRAB10) that are 
      exquisitely selective for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab10, detecting endogenous 
      phosphorylated Rab10 in all analysed cell lines and tissues, including human brain 
      cingulate cortex. We demonstrate that the MJFF-pRAB10 antibodies can be deployed to 
      assess enhanced Rab10 phosphorylation resulting from pathogenic (R1441C/G or G2019S) 
      LRRK2 knock-in mutations as well as the impact of LRRK2 inhibitor treatment. We also 
      identify rabbit monoclonal antibodies displaying broad specificity (MJFF-pRAB8) that 
      can be utilised to assess LRRK2-controlled phosphorylation of a range of endogenous 
      Rab proteins, including Rab8A, Rab10 and Rab35. The antibodies described in the 
      present study will help with the assessment of LRRK2 activity and examination of 
      which Rab proteins are phosphorylated in vivo These antibodies could also be used to 
      assess the impact of LRRK2 inhibitors in future clinical trials.

TI  - Dual inhibition of monoamine oxidase B and antagonism of the adenosine A(2A) 
      receptor by (E,E)-8-(4-phenylbutadien-1-yl)caffeine analogues.
PG  - 8676-84
LID - 10.1016/j.bmc.2008.07.088 [doi]
AB  - The adenosine A(2A) receptor has emerged as an attractive target for the treatment 
      of Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence suggests that antagonists of the A(2A) 
      receptor (A(2A) antagonists) may be neuroprotective and may help to alleviate the 
      symptoms of PD. We have reported recently that several members of the 
      (E)-8-styrylcaffeine class of A(2A) antagonists also are potent inhibitors of 
      monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Since MAO-B inhibitors are known to possess 
      anti-parkinsonian properties, dual-target-directed drugs that block both MAO-B and 
      A(2A) receptors may have enhanced value in the management of PD. In an attempt to 
      explore this concept further we have prepared three additional classes of C-8 
      substituted caffeinyl analogues. The 8-phenyl- and 8-benzylcaffeinyl analogues 
      exhibited relatively weak MAO-B inhibition potencies while selected 
      (E,E)-8-(4-phenylbutadien-1-yl)caffeinyl analogues were found to be exceptionally 
      potent reversible MAO-B inhibitors with enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants 
      (K(i) values) ranging from 17 to 149 nM. Furthermore, these 
      (E,E)-8-(4-phenylbutadien-1-yl)caffeines acted as potent A(2A) antagonists with K(i) 
      values ranging from 59 to 153 nM. We conclude that the 
      (E,E)-8-(4-phenylbutadien-1-yl)caffeines are a promising candidate class of 
      dual-acting compounds.

TI  - Differentiating tardive dyskinesia: a video-based review of antipsychotic-induced 
      movement disorders in clinical practice.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1017/S109285292000200X [doi]
AB  - Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) are 
      imperative, as its symptoms can be highly disruptive to both patients and their 
      caregivers. Misdiagnosis can lead to incorrect interventions with suboptimal or even 
      deleterious results. To aid in the identification and differentiation of TD in the 
      psychiatric practice setting, we review its clinical features and movement 
      phenomenology, as well as those of other antipsychotic-induced movement disorders, 
      with accompanying links to illustrative videos. Exposure to dopamine receptor 
      blocking agents (DRBAs) such as antipsychotics or antiemetics is associated with a 
      spectrum of movement disorders including TD. The differential diagnosis of TD is 
      based on history of DRBA exposure, recent discontinuation or dose reduction of a 
      DRBA, and movement phenomenology. Common diagnostic challenges are the abnormal 
      behaviors and dyskinesias associated with advanced age or chronic mental illness, 
      and other movement disorders associated with DRBA therapy, such as akathisia, 
      parkinsonian tremor, and tremor related to use of mood stabilizing agents (eg, 
      lithium, divalproex). Duration of exposure may help rule out acute drug-induced 
      syndromes such as acute dystonia or acute/subacute akathisia. Another important 
      consideration is the potential for TD to present together with other drug-induced 
      movement disorders (eg, parkinsonism, parkinsonian tremor, and postural tremor from 
      mood stabilizers) in the same patient, which can complicate both diagnosis and 
      management. After documentation of the phenomenology, severity, and distribution of 
      TD movements, treatment options should be reviewed with the patient and caregivers.

TI  - Wearing off: A complex phenomenon often poorly recognized in Parkinson's disease. A 
      study with the WOQ-19 questionnaire.
PG  - 1271-1279
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.217959 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: 'Wearing off' refers to the phenomenology of movement disorders in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) that appears early and is much commoner than generally 
      believed. It may be present in the form of either motor symptoms or non-motor 
      symptoms. AIM: To investigate the utility of wearing-off questionnaire (WOQ-19, 
      Italian version) in the outpatient clinical practice to assess the suitability of 
      different combinations of treatment, in various stages of PD. METHODS: 73 
      consecutive patients (58% male and 42% female) suffering from PD were recruited 
      through the Santorso Hospital and San Martino Hospital from September 2012 to March 
      2014. The patients were asked to indicate whether or not they experienced any of the 
      19 symptoms listed in the questionnaire during the day; if one or more of these 
      referred symptoms relating to PD improved after taking an additional dose of 
      levodopa; and, if these variations were present routinely. Furthermore, we also 
      evaluated the possible correlation between the presence of motor and non-motor 
      symptoms that were listed in the WOQ 19 with the motor impairment assessed by the 
      Hoehn and Yahr stage (HY) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
      part III motor section, in the whole patient cohort as well as in different 
      subgroups undergoing therapy. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients, 22% were receiving 
      levodopa (a mean daily dose of 300 ± 121.3 mg), 38.3% levodopa and dopamine 
      agonists, 12.3% levodopa/rasagiline, 8.2% levodopa/selegiline, and 19.2% a 
      combination of levodopa/dopamine agonists (DA)/monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI). 
      The most prevalent symptoms were the non-motor symptoms included in the WOQ-19. A 
      significant correlation between the scores obtained on the different motor and 
      non-motor items recorded by the WOQ-19 and the UPDRS motor section and HY scores was 
      found. The therapeutic benefit was especially related to the motor symptoms. 
      DISCUSSION: In clinical practice, this simple and easily administered questionnaire 
      may be useful for the early detection of fluctuations in symptomatology in patients 
      with PD. It will, therefore, help to improve the quality of the global care of 
      patients with PD detected in various stages of the disease.

TI  - Vigabatrin. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and 
      therapeutic potential in epilepsy and disorders of motor control.
PG  - 889-926
AB  - Vigabatrin was specifically designed to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
      function in the CNS. By increasing brain concentrations of this inhibitory 
      neurotransmitter the drug appears to decrease propagation of abnormal 
      hypersynchronous discharges, thereby reducing seizure activity. At this stage in its 
      development, clinical experience with vigabatrin is limited primarily to patients 
      with refractory seizure disorders. In this difficult-to-treat population, 'add-on' 
      therapy with vigabatrin greater than or equal to 2 g/day has shown impressive 
      efficacy, reducing seizure frequency by greater than or equal to 50% in 
      approximately half of patients. Clinical efficacy does seem to vary with seizure 
      type with the best response reported in adults with complex partial seizures with or 
      without generalisation and in children with cryptogenic partial epilepsy or 
      symptomatic infantile spasm. Vigabatrin appears to have a negative effect on 
      absences and myoclonic seizures. Some disorders of motor control may also be 
      amenable to enhanced GABAergic function. In the small number of patients with 
      tardive dyskinesia treated to date, vigabatrin produced mild to moderate improvement 
      in hyperkinetic symptom scores but Parkinsonism or schizophrenic symptoms 
      occasionally worsened. The best response was reported in a study of patients who had 
      been withdrawn from neuroleptic therapy. In a small but well-controlled comparative 
      trial, vigabatrin was as effective as baclofen in reducing spasm and improving some 
      parameters of spasticity in patients with spinal cord lesions or multiple sclerosis. 
      Most adverse reactions to vigabatrin are mild and transient with central nervous 
      system (CNS) changes being reported most frequently. Of particular note, serial 
      evoked potential studies and the few available histology reports have not found 
      evidence of intramyelinic oedema during therapeutic use, as was reported in rats and 
      dogs on chronic high-dose treatment. Thus, vigabatrin is a promising new 
      anticonvulsant drug. Current evidence supports a trial of this agent as adjunctive 
      therapy in patients with refractory seizure disorders, and future investigation of 
      vigabatrin monotherapy and its efficacy relative to established agents is awaited 
      with interest. Wider experience should help to clarify which patients - by seizure 
      type and concurrent CNS pathology - are likely to benefit from vigabatrin and 
      ongoing monitoring should further clarify the potential detrimental effects, if any, 
      of long term use. In the meantime, it is a welcome addition in the difficult setting 
      of resistant epilepsy.

AB  - We measured the functional agonist potencies of dopamine agonists including 
      antiparkinson drugs, and functional antagonist potencies of antipsychotics at human 
      dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors. In vitro pharmacological assessment included 
      inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and the reversal of 
      dopamine-induced inhibition in clonal Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing low and 
      high densities of human dopamine D(2L) and D(2S) receptors (hD(2L)-Low, hD(2L)-High, 
      hD(2S)-Low and hD(2S)-High, respectively) and human dopamine D(3) Ser-9 and D(3) 
      Gly-9 receptors (hD(3)-Ser-9 and hD(3)-Gly-9, respectively). Cabergoline, 
      bromocriptine, pergolide, (±)-7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT), 
      talipexole, pramipexole, 
      R-(+)-trans-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-4-propyl-2H,5H-[1]benzopyrano[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-olhydrochloride 
      (PD128907) and ropinirole behaved as dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor full agonists 
      and showed higher potencies in hD(2L)-High and hD(2S)-High compared to hD(2L)-Low 
      and hD(2S)-Low. In hD(3)-Ser-9 and hD(3)-Gly-9 compared to hD(2L)-Low and 
      hD(2S)-Low, dopamine, ropinirole, PD128907, and pramipexole potencies were clearly 
      higher; talipexole and 7-OH-DPAT showed slightly higher potencies; pergolide showed 
      slightly lower potency; and, cabergoline and bromocriptine potencies were lower. 
      Aripiprazole acted as an antagonist in hD(2L)-Low; a low intrinsic activity partial 
      agonist in hD(2S)-Low; a moderate partial agonist in hD(3)-Ser-9 and hD(3)-Gly-9; a 
      robust partial agonist in hD(2L)-High; and a full agonist in hD(2S)-High. 
      Amisulpride, sulpiride and perphenazine behaved as preferential antagonists; and 
      chlorpromazine and asenapine behaved as modest preferential antagonists; whereas 
      fluphenazine, haloperidol, and blonanserin behaved as non-preferential antagonists 
      in hD(2S)-Low and hD(2S)-High compared to hD(3)-Ser-9 and hD(3)-Gly-9. These 
      findings may help to elucidate the basis of therapeutic benefit observed with these 
      drugs, with varying mechanisms of action, in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, 
      depression and schizophrenia.

TI  - Drug therapy for Parkinson's disease in the elderly.
PG  - 124-46
AB  - The diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease in the elderly is complicated by 
      the common presence of multiple pathology and age related changes in drug handling. 
      Accurate diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion combined with careful 
      assessment before and after a trial of therapy. A multidisciplinary approach is 
      required to help the patient, and their carer, cope with the fundamental 
      disabilities resulting from Parkinson's disease. The elderly are more susceptible to 
      side effects from antiparkinsonian medication and close supervision is therefore 
      essential.

TI  - Effect of monoamine reuptake inhibitor NS 2330 in advanced Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1183-6
AB  - Dopamine reuptake blockers, by enhancing and stabilizing intrasynaptic transmitter 
      levels, could help palliate motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. This 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the acute effects of the 
      monoamine uptake inhibitor NS 2330 to those of placebo in 9 relatively advanced 
      parkinsonian patients. At the dose administered, no change in parkinsonian scores 
      was found when NS 2330 was given alone or with levodopa. Moreover, NS 2330 
      coadministration did not appear to alter dyskinesia severity or the duration of the 
      antiparkinsonian response to levodopa. The drug was well tolerated. Under the 
      conditions of this study, the present results failed to support the usefulness of 
      dopamine reuptake inhibition in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of [(11) C]GNE-1023 as a Potent PET Probe for 
      Imaging Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) in Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - 1580-1585
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.201900321 [doi]
AB  - Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a large protein involved in the pathogenesis 
      of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been demonstrated that PD is mainly conferred by 
      LRRK2 mutations that bring about increased kinase activity. As a consequence, 
      selective inhibition of LRRK2 may help to recover the normal functions of LRRK2, 
      thereby serving as a promising alternative therapeutic target for PD treatment. The 
      mapping of LRRK2 by positron emission tomography (PET) studies allows a thorough 
      understanding of PD and other LRRK2-related disorders; it also helps to validate and 
      translate novel LRRK2 inhibitors. However, no LRRK2 PET probes have yet been 
      reported in the primary literature. Herein we present a facile synthesis and 
      preliminary evaluation of [(11) C]GNE-1023 as a novel potent PET probe for LRRK2 
      imaging in PD. [(11) C]GNE-1023 was synthesized in good radiochemical yield (10 % 
      non-decay-corrected RCY), excellent radiochemical purity (>99 %), and high molar 
      activity (>37 GBq μmol(-1) ). Excellent in vitro binding specificity of [(11) 
      C]GNE-1023 toward LRRK2 was demonstrated in cross-species studies, including rat and 
      nonhuman primate brain tissues by autoradiography experiments. Subsequent whole-body 
      biodistribution studies indicated limited brain uptake and urinary and hepatobiliary 
      elimination of this radioligand. This study may pave the way for further development 
      of a new generation of LRRK2 PET probes.

AB  - Chronic neurodegenerative syndromes such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, or 
      acute syndromes such as ischemic stroke or traumatic brain injuries are 
      characterized by early synaptic collapse which precedes axonal and neuronal cell 
      body degeneration and promotes early cognitive impairment in patients. Until now, 
      neuroprotective strategies have failed to impede the progression of 
      neurodegenerative syndromes. Drugs preventing the loss of cell body do not prevent 
      the cognitive decline, probably because they lack synapto-protective effects. The 
      absence of physiologically realistic neuronal network models which can be easily 
      handled has hindered the development of synapto-protective drugs suitable for 
      therapies. Here we describe a new microfluidic platform which makes it possible to 
      study the consequences of axonal trauma of reconstructed oriented mouse neuronal 
      networks. Each neuronal population and sub-compartment can be chemically addressed 
      individually. The somatic, mid axon, presynaptic and postsynaptic effects of local 
      pathological stresses or putative protective molecules can thus be evaluated with 
      the help of this versatile "brain on chip" platform. We show that presynaptic loss 
      is the earliest event observed following axotomy of cortical fibers, before any sign 
      of axonal fragmentation or post-synaptic spine alteration. This platform can be used 
      to screen and evaluate the synapto-protective potential of several drugs. For 
      instance, NAD⁺ and the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 can efficiently prevent synaptic 
      disconnection, whereas the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and the 
      stilbenoid resveratrol do not prevent presynaptic degeneration. Hence, this platform 
      is a promising tool for fundamental research in the field of developmental and 
      neurodegenerative neurosciences, and also offers the opportunity to set up 
      pharmacological screening of axon-protective and synapto-protective drugs.

TI  - Quality measures for medication continuity in long-term care facilities, using a 
      structured panel process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient transitions, such as transfers between acute and long-term care 
      (LTC), aposare times when the likelihood of communication failure between healthcare 
      providers is increased. Employing appropriate health quality indicators helps 
      support improvement efforts. To date, few quality indicators that evaluate the 
      continuity of medication use between acute and LTC facilities have been described. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop quality indicators signalling the 
      potential discontinuation of previously prescribed medications for chronic diseases 
      when residents return to LTC following an acute-care hospitalization. METHODS: A 
      literature review for the selection of potential indicators was conducted, followed 
      by a three-step process: (i) initial screening round that rated the indicators; (ii) 
      a 1-day in-person consensus meeting in which the panel refined the parameters 
      regarding the proposed quality indicators; and (iii) a final anonymous survey that 
      assessed consensus among panel members. The study setting was a survey and consensus 
      meeting with national representation, held in Toronto, ON, Canada. A ten-member 
      expert panel with broad geographical and clinical representation participated and 
      was made up of registered nurses, physicians, pharmacists, policy makers and 
      academic researchers. A 75% agreement threshold was required for consensus, as 
      measured on a 9-point Likert-type scale. The panel evaluated quality indicators for 
      effectiveness, relevance and feasibility, using currently available healthcare 
      administrative data. RESULTS: The panel reached consensus on four quality indicators 
      to assess the unintentional discontinuation of medications prescribed to LTC 
      residents for chronic diseases upon return to LTC after an acute-care admission. The 
      selected indicators were (i) HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for all 
      indications; (ii) anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) for the indication of atrial 
      fibrillation; (iii) proton-pump inhibitors for the indication of 
      post-gastrointestinal haemorrhage; and (iv) thyroxine for all indications. The panel 
      identified three additional treatment groups for future consideration as quality 
      indicators: anti-Parkinson's disease, anti-diabetes and antidepressant medications. 
      CONCLUSION: A novel set of quality indicators has been developed to evaluate 
      medication continuity between acute and LTC facilities. The adoption and 
      implementation of these indicators in clinical practice can help inform quality 
      improvement efforts at various local and regional levels.

TI  - Should the injured and intact hemispheres be treated differently during the early 
      phases of physical restorative therapy in experimental stroke or parkinsonism?
PG  - S27-46
AB  - Over a century ago the intact cortex was proposed to contribute to recovery from 
      unilateral brain injury, but its possible role in functional outcome has become more 
      appreciated in recent years as a result of anatomic, metabolic and behavioral 
      studies. Although use of the contralesional limb is naturally impaired after 
      sensorimotor cortex injury, neural and astrocytic events in the intact hemisphere 
      may give rise to, and may be influenced by, an enhanced ability to compensate for 
      lost motor function. The debate is still open as to whether the neural changes are 
      generally compensatory in nature, with activity in the homotopic cortex leading to 
      greater capability in the nonimpaired limb, or whether they are actually a matter of 
      reorganization in the homotopic cortex leading to connections to denervated targets 
      in the opposite hemisphere, thus allowing the homotopic cortex to control motor 
      programs there. Although both phenomena may occur to some degree, there is mounting 
      evidence in support of the former view. Careful behavioral techniques have been 
      developed that can expose compensatory tricks, and the time course of these 
      behaviors correlates well with anatomic data. Moreover, if the intact cortex 
      sustains a second lesion after recovery from the first, forelimb sensorimotor 
      function specific to the first-impaired side of the body is not worsened. Partial 
      denervation of callosal fibers coming from the injured hemisphere, plus preferential 
      use of the good forelimb caused by a cortical injury, may increase trophic factors 
      in the intact hemisphere. These and related events seem to provide a 
      growth-favorable environment there that permits motor learning in the intact 
      forelimb at a level of skill exceeding that which a normal animal can attain in the 
      same period of time. There are anecdotal cases in human neurologic patients that are 
      consistent with these findings. For example, a colleague of the authors who 
      sustained a unilateral infarction that rendered his dominant right hand severely 
      impaired noticed that soon after the stroke he was able to use his left hand for 
      writing and computers as well as he had ever used his right hand. Cross-midline 
      placing tests also indicate that the structural events observed in the intact cortex 
      may potentiate projections to the damaged hemisphere. These changes may help restore 
      the capacity of tactile information projecting to the intact hemisphere to control 
      limb placing in the impaired forelimb. Neural events in the injured hemisphere can 
      be affected by behavior differently than the neural events in the intact hemisphere. 
      Different therapeutic strategies might well be used on opposing limbs at different 
      times after unilateral sensorimotor cortex injury to optimize recovery (and, indeed, 
      to avoid exaggerating the insult). Finally, the details of reorganization in both 
      hemispheres differ greatly depending on the type of brain injury sustained (eg, in 
      stroke versus Parkinson's disease), suggesting that an approach that considers the 
      role of both hemispheres is likely to be beneficial in research on a broad variety 
      of brain pathologies.

TI  - Rasagiline meta-analysis: a spotlight on clinical safety and adverse events when 
      treating Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 479-86
LID - 10.1517/14740338.2013.790956 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rasagiline (Azilect, AGN 1135) is a selective irreversible inhibitor 
      of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). MAO-B regulates the brain concentrations of 
      important neurotransmitters that are related to movement, emotion, and cognition. 
      Oral rasagiline, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to levodopa, was effective 
      in the symptomatic treatment of adult patients with Parkinson's disease 
      participating in double-blind, placebo-controlled, international studies. AREAS 
      COVERED: This article reviews the reported adverse effects of rasagiline. A MEDLINE 
      search was performed for all articles from 1990 to present, which reported any 
      adverse effects from rasagiline or related references. We conducted an analysis of 
      the adverse effects of rasagiline based on the reported clinical studies. 
      Furthermore, we compared the incidence of adverse events in clinical trials for 
      rasagiline and placebo. EXPERT OPINION: Among the most frequently reported adverse 
      effects for rasagiline as monotherapy are headache, dizziness, and insomnia. 
      Depression, dizziness, somnolence, and other sleep disorders are reported when used 
      in combination therapy. Our analysis demonstrates that the most frequently reported 
      adverse effects in trials did not occur more often with rasagiline than placebo. In 
      conclusion, rasagiline is a well-tolerated MAO-B inhibitor that may help to achieve 
      the desired level of clinical benefit in Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Dopamine reuptake from extracellular space to cytosol leads to accumulation of 
      dopamine, which triggers neurotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons. Previous studies 
      have shown that both dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and dopamine transporter (DAT) are 
      involved in dopamine neurotoxicity. However, blockade of either D2R or DAT causes 
      side effects due to antagonism of other physiological functions of these two 
      proteins. We previously found that DAT can form a protein complex with D2R and its 
      cell surface expression is facilitated via D2R-DAT interaction, which regulates 
      dopamine reuptake and intracellular dopamine levels. Here we found that an 
      interfering peptide (DAT-S1) disrupting the D2R-DAT interaction protects neurons 
      against dopamine neurotoxicity, and this effect is mediated by inhibiting DAT cell 
      surface expression and inhibiting both caspase-3 and PARP-1 cleavage. This study 
      demonstrates the role of the D2R-DAT complex in dopamine neurotoxicity and 
      investigated the potential mechanisms, which might help better understand the 
      mechanisms of dopamine neurotoxicity. The peptide may provide some insights to 
      improve treatments for dopamine neurotoxicity and related diseases, such as 
      Parkinson's disease, as well as methamphetamine- and 3,4-methsylenedioxy 
      methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity.

TI  - Boosting Drug Discovery for Parkinson's: Enhancement of the Delivery of a Monoamine 
      Oxidase-B Inhibitor by Brain-Targeted PEGylated Polycaprolactone-Based 
      Nanoparticles.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics11070331 [doi]
LID - 331
AB  - The current pharmacological treatments for Parkinson's disease only offer 
      symptomatic relief to the patients and are based on the administration of levodopa 
      and catechol-O-methyltransferase or monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors (IMAO-B). Since 
      the majority of drug candidates fail in pre- and clinical trials, due largely to 
      bioavailability pitfalls, the use of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery 
      systems has been reported as an interesting tool to increase the stealth capacity of 
      drugs or help drug candidates to surpass biological barriers, among other benefits. 
      Thus, a novel potent, selective, and reversible IMAO-B (chromone C27, IC(50) = 670 ± 
      130 pM) was encapsulated in poly(caprolactone) (PCL) NPs by a nanoprecipitation 
      process. The resulting C27-loaded PEGylated PCL NPs (~213 nm) showed high stability 
      and no cytotoxic effects in neuronal (SH-SY5Y), epithelial (Caco-2), and endothelial 
      (hCMEC/D3) cells. An accumulation of PEGylated PCL NPs in the cytoplasm of SH-SY5Y 
      and hCMEC/D3 cells was also observed, and their permeation across Caco-2 and 
      hCMEC/D3 cell monolayers, used as in vitro models of the human intestine and 
      blood-brain barrier, respectively, was demonstrated. PEGylated PCL NPs delivered C27 
      at concentrations higher than the MAO-B IC(50) value, which provides evidence of 
      their relevance to solving the drug discovery pitfalls.

TI  - Autoxidation and MAO-mediated metabolism of dopamine as a potential cause of 
      oxidative stress: role of ferrous and ferric ions.
PG  - 103-16
AB  - The autoxidation and monoamine oxidase (MAO)-mediated metabolism of dopamine 
      (3-hydroxytyramine; DA) cause a continuous production of hydroxyl radical (*OH), 
      which is further enhanced by the presence of iron (ferrous iron, Fe(2+) and ferric 
      ion, Fe(3+)). The accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of Fe(2+) 
      appears to discard the involvement of the Fenton reaction in this process. It has 
      been found that the presence of DA significantly reduces the formation of 
      thiobarbituric acid reagent substances (TBARS), which under physiological conditions 
      takes place in mitochondrial preparations. The presence of DA is also able to reduce 
      TBARS formation in mitochondrial preparations even in the presence of iron (Fe(2+) 
      and Fe(3+)). However, DA boosted the carbonyl content of mitochondrial proteins, 
      which was further increased in the presence of iron (Fe(2+) and Fe(3+)). This latter 
      effect is also accompanied by a significant reduction in thiol content of 
      mitochondrial proteins. It has also been observed how the pre-incubation of 
      mitochondria with pargyline, an acetylenic MAO inhibitor, reduces the production of 
      *OH and increases the formation of TBARS. Although, the MAO-mediated metabolism of 
      DA increases MAO-B activity, the presence of iron inhibits both MAO-A and MAO-B 
      activities. Consequently, DA has been shown to be a double-edged sword, because it 
      displays antioxidant properties in relation to both the Fenton reaction and lipid 
      peroxidation and exhibits pro-oxidant properties by causing both generation *OH and 
      oxidation of mitochondrial proteins. Evidently, these pro-oxidant properties of DA 
      help explain the long-term side effects derived from l-DOPA treatment of Parkinson's 
      disease and its exacerbation by the concomitant use of DA metabolism inhibitors.

TI  - [Depression in elderly].
PG  - 389-93
AB  - Depression is frequent among aged persons and its diagnosis is difficult, because 
      certain clinical presentations are unusual, explaining undertreatment. Depression is 
      observed not only in ancient depressive people but can also be shown on elderly 
      without previous mood disorders. Somatic symptoms often mask depression. More over, 
      somatic diseases can interfere with depression. A hypochondria is always associated 
      with depression in old patients, patients expressing in this a particular way a 
      psychological pain. Loss of motivation is sometime a depression in aged people, 
      associated with a dysexecutive syndrome or, elsewhere, aggressiveness can reveals a 
      hostile depression. At a worst stage of the disease, in particular, when a dementia 
      is latent, confusion is present. A therapeutic test with an antidepressant can help 
      to discriminate between a dementia with depressive symptoms or a depression with a 
      confusion. But, even if the cognitive disorders disappear with the treatment, a 
      dementia can appear years after.

      Parkinson's Disease and Other Brain Disorders.
PG  - 746-58
LID - 10.1038/mt.2015.232 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, for which there is no 
      effective treatment available till date. Here, we report the development of nonviral 
      vectors specific for neuronal cells that can deliver short interfering RNA (siRNA) 
      against the α-synuclein gene (SNCA), and prevent PD-like symptoms both in vitro and 
      in vivo. These vectors not only help siRNA duplexes cross the blood-brain barrier in 
      mice, but also stabilize these siRNAs leading to a sustainable 60-90% knockdown of 
      α-synuclein protein. Mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine 
      rapidly develop PD-like symptoms which were significantly alleviated when SNCA was 
      knocked down using our vectors. Together, our data not only confirm the central role 
      of α-synuclein in the onset of PD, but also provide a proof of principle that these 
      nonviral vectors can be used as novel tools to design effective strategies to combat 
      central nervous system diseases.

AB  - Activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 MAPK death signaling 
      cascade is implicated in the death of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated upstream activators of ASK1 using an MPTP 
      mouse model of parkinsonism and assessed the temporal cascade of death signaling in 
      ventral midbrain (VMB) and striatum (ST). MPTP selectively activated ASK1 and 
      downstream p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner in VMB alone. This occurred through 
      selective protein thiol oxidation of the redox-sensitive thiol disulfide 
      oxidoreductase, thioredoxin (Trx1), resulting in release of its inhibitory 
      association with ASK1, while glutathione-S-transferase µ 1 (GSTM1) remained in 
      reduced form in association with ASK1. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a 
      known activator of ASK1, increased early after MPTP in VMB. Protein covariation 
      network analysis (PCNA) using protein states as nodes revealed TNF to be an 
      important node regulating the ASK1 signaling cascade. In confirmation, blocking 
      MPTP-mediated TNF signaling through intrathecal administration of TNF-neutralizing 
      antibody prevented Trx1 oxidation and downstream ASK1-p38 MAPK activation. Averting 
      an early increase in TNF, which leads to protein thiol oxidation resulting in 
      activation of ASK1-p38 signaling, may be critical for neuroprotection in PD. 
      Importantly, network analysis can help in understanding the cause/effect 
      relationship within protein networks in complex disease states.

AB  - In vivo methylphenidate (MPD) administration decreases vesicular monoamine 
      transporter-2 (VMAT-2) immunoreactivity in membrane-associated vesicles isolated 
      from the striata of treated rats while concurrently kinetically upregulating 
      VMAT-2-mediated vesicular dopamine (DA) sequestration. The functional consequences 
      of these MPD-induced effects include an increase in both vesicular DA content and 
      exocytotic DA release. This report describes experiments designed to develop and 
      validate an in vitro MPD model to further elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) 
      underlying the effects of MPD on the VMAT-2 in membrane-associated vesicles. Method 
      development experiments revealed that in vitro MPD incubation of striatal 
      homogenates, but not striatal synaptosomes, increased DA transport velocities and 
      decreased VMAT-2 immunoreactivity in membrane-associated vesicles. An incubation 
      time of 30min with a MPD concentration of 10mM was optimal. Method validation 
      experiments indicated that in vitro MPD incubation kinetically upregulated VMAT-2 in 
      membrane-associated vesicles, increased vesicular DA content, and increased 
      exocytotic DA release. These results reveal that the in vitro MPD incubation model 
      successfully reproduced the salient features of in vivo MPD administration. This in 
      vitro MPD incubation model may provide novel insights into the receptor-mediated 
      mechanism(s) of action of in vivo MPD in the striatum as well as the physiological 
      regulation of vesicular DA sequestration and synaptic transmission. Accordingly, 
      this in vitro model may help to advance the treatment of disorders involving 
      abnormal DA disposition including Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder, and substance abuse.

TI  - Integrated pharmacokinetic and metabolic modeling of selegiline and metabolites 
      after transdermal administration.
PG  - 567-84
AB  - Selegiline (SEL) is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B, used in the 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease, either alone or as an adjunct to L-DOPA. 
      Selegiline hydrochloride (HCl) undergoes significant first-pass metabolism following 
      oral administration. Transdermal delivery avoids the first-pass effect and provides 
      greater and more prolonged levels of unchanged SEL and reduced levels of metabolites 
      (N-desmethylselegiline (DES), L-amphetamine (AMP), and L-methamphetamine (MET) 
      compared to the oral regimen. An integrated pharmacokinetic-metabolic model which 
      predicts plasma concentrations of SEL and metabolites following a single 24 h 
      application of a selegiline transdermal system (STS) is proposed. The model is based 
      on the metabolic conversion of SEL to DES and MET and subsequently to AMP. The input 
      function is described by a zero-order constant for the delivery of SEL from the STS 
      system based on in vitro studies of penetration of SEL across human skin. The 
      elimination-non-metabolic constants for each analyte account for the urinary 
      elimination. Plasma concentration data from a pilot pharmacokinetic study in which 
      six healthy male volunteers were administered single 24 h applications of a 1.8 mg 
      cm2, 10 cm2 STS were used to examine this model. The coefficient of determination 
      was 0.98 and model selection criterion was 3.4 for mean data fits, supporting the 
      goodness of fit of the model. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained by 
      non-compartmental analysis were comparable to those predicted by a compartmental 
      model. The model also predicted urinary recoveries for AMP and MET and negligible 
      recovery for SEL and DES consistent with recent studies with the STS in which urine 
      was collected. The metabolic conversion constant from SEL to DES was significantly 
      lower than the conversion constant from SEL to MET, indicating that metabolism of 
      SEL is primarily driven towards MET following transdermal administration. The 
      metabolic conversion from MET to AMP was less than the conversion from DES to AMP. 
      This simultaneous prediction of the SEL and metabolites is essential as the 
      metabolic ratios have been linked to the neuroprotective effects of SEL. These 
      findings support the proposed regional delivery advantage attributed to the 
      transdermal route compared to the conventional therapy with the oral tablet. Future 
      model applications may also help identify significant covariates (i.e. age, gender, 
      and disease state) in upcoming clinical trials.

TI  - Monoamine transporter availability in Parkinson's disease patients with or without 
      depression.
PG  - 428-35
LID - 10.1007/s00259-008-0979-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Depression is a common symptom in patients suffering from Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) and markedly reduces their quality of life. As post-mortem studies have 
      shown, its presence may reflect extensive cell loss in the midbrain and brainstem 
      with imbalances in monoaminergic neurotransmitters. However, in vivo evidence of 
      specific monoaminergic deficits in depressed PD patients is still sparse. Therefore, 
      we studied PD patients with depression (PD+D) and without depression (PD-D) using 
      high-resolution single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and the monoamine 
      transporter marker [(123)I]FP-CIT. METHODS: A magnetic resonance imaging-based 
      region-of-interest analysis was applied to quantify the specific-to-nondisplaceable 
      [(123)I]FP-CIT binding coefficient V(3)'' in the striatum, thalamus and 
      midbrain/brainstem regions. RESULTS: PD+D patients had significantly lower V(3)'' 
      compared with PD-D patients in the striatum (p<0.001), thalamus (p=0.002), and 
      midbrain/brainstem (p=0.025). Only PD+D patients without selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment showed lower thalamic and midbrain V(3)'' than 
      controls (p<0.001, p=0.029). In a small sub-group of SSRI-treated PD+D patients 
      neither thalamic V(3)'' nor midbrain/brainstem V(3)'' differed from those in PD-D 
      patients (p=0.168, p=0.201) or controls (p=0.384, p=0.318). CONCLUSION: Our data 
      indicate that depression in PD is associated with a more pronounced loss of striatal 
      dopamine transporter availability that is most likely secondary to increased 
      dopaminergic degeneration. In addition, depressed PD patients have a lower 
      availability of midbrain/brainstem monoamine transporters than nondepressed PD 
      patients. These findings provide in vivo evidence in support of the known 
      post-mortem data demonstrating more extensive nerve cell loss in PD with depression 
      and indicate that SPECT imaging can help to identify pathophysiological changes 
      underlying nonmotor symptoms in this common movement disorder.

AB  - Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is a promising target for the treatment of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. We report the synthesis and the biological evaluation 
      of halogenated derivatives of 1-aryliden-2-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)hydrazines. The 
      fluorinated series shows interesting activity and great selectivity toward the human 
      recombinant MAO-B isoform expressed in baculovirus infected BTI insect cells. The 
      multiple crystal structures alignment of the enzyme highlighted pronounced induced 
      fit (IF) adaptations with respect to bound ligands. Therefore, IF docking (IFD) 
      experiments and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were carried out to reveal the 
      putative binding mode and to explain the experimentally observed differences in the 
      activity of 1-(aryliden-2-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)hydrazines. The importance 
      of water molecules within the binding site was also investigated. These are known to 
      play an important role in the binding site cavity and to mediate protein-ligand 
      interactions. Detailed analyses of the trajectories provide insights on the chemical 
      features required for the activity of this scaffold. In particular it was 
      highlighted the importance of fluorine atom interacting with the water close to the 
      cofactor and the influence of steric bulkiness of substituents in the arylidene 
      moiety. Free energy perturbation (FEP) analysis confirmed experimental data. The 
      information we deduced will help to develop novel high-affinity MAO-B inhibitors.

TI  - Selective activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in dopaminergic neurons 
      of substantia nigra leads to nuclear translocation of p53 in 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
      the degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta 
      (SNpc). Activation of the mixed lineage kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has 
      been reported in models of PD. Our focus was to discern whether distinct pathways 
      were activated in cell-specific manner within the SNpc. We now demonstrate the 
      selective phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase within the dopaminergic neurons, whereas 
      JNK activation occurs predominantly in the microglia. p38 activation results in 
      downstream phosphorylation of p53 and increased p53 mediated transcription of Bax 
      and Puma in the ventral midbrain. Treatment with p38 inhibitor, SB239063 protected 
      primary dopaminergic neurons derived from human progenitor cells from MPP(+) 
      mediated cell death and prevented the downstream phosphorylation of p53 and its 
      translocation to the nucleus in vivo, in the ventral midbrain. The increased 
      staining of phosphorylated p38 in the surviving neurons of SNpc in human brain 
      sections from patients with PD and in MPTP treated mice but not in the ventral 
      tegmental area provides further evidence suggesting a role for p38 in the 
      degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of SNpc. We thus demonstrate the cell specific

AB  - Clinical features at onset of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may mimic symptoms of 
      Lewy bodies dementia. Clinical evolution, neuroimaging, metabolism exploration, and 
      cerebrospinal fluid investigations may help establishing the diagnosis. However, CJD 
      definite diagnosis requires postmortem autopsy. This symptom overlap led us to 
      successfully prescribe an anticholinesterasic treatment, rivastigmine, to a patient 
      for whom a probable CJD disease was finally diagnosed.

TI  - An intermittent, controlled-rate, slow progressive degeneration model of Parkinson's 
      disease: antiparkinson effects of Sinemet and protective effects of methylphenidate.
PG  - 201-13
AB  - The causes of nigrostriatal neuron degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) are not 
      known, but it has been suggested that exogenous or endogenous factors or neurotoxins 
      may play a role. The degree of vulnerability to neurotoxins or other potential 
      mediators of nigral dopamine cell death is thought to be important in understanding 
      Parkinson's disease. In most animal models, the rate of terminal degeneration and 
      corresponding functional impairment is too rapid to investigate effectively either 
      cell vulnerability or the potential benefits of some neuroprotective treatments. In 
      the present study, a new model of Parkinson's disease is described that might help 
      in addressing the issue of nigral cell vulnerability and to evaluate interventions 
      with clinical potential. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was infused in escalating, 
      intrastriatal doses over several weeks. Control animals received multiple infusions 
      of vehicle at the same volume. Behavioral testing was carried out between each 
      infusion, including forelimb-use and somatosensory function. A symptomatic threshold 
      was established for each animal, indicating the amount of neurotoxin required to 
      induce a stable deficit. Oral administration of L-DOPA (Sinemet) ameliorated 
      limb-use asymmetries acutely. An immunocytochemical assay for tyrosine hydroxylase, 
      a dopamine cell marker, revealed a partial loss of immunoreactive cells in the 
      substantia nigra. Animals that were co-administered methylphenidate (MPH), a 
      dopamine transport inhibitor, along with the 6-OHDA were spared from the behavioral 
      and neurochemical effects of 6-OHDA, despite receiving more than twice as much 
      neurotoxin as controls. These data suggest that establishing a symptomatic threshold 
      preclinically may help researchers evaluate potential treatments and model 
      individual and group resistance to nigrostriatal insults.

AB  - The development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and 
      Huntington disease is strongly age-dependent. Discovering drugs that act on the high 
      rate of aging in older individuals could be a means of combating these diseases. 
      Reduction of the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme CLK-1 (also known as COQ7) 
      slows down aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mice. Clioquinol is a metal 
      chelator that has beneficial effects in several cellular and animal models of 
      neurodegenerative diseases as well as on Alzheimer disease patients. Here we show 
      that clioquinol inhibits the activity of mammalian CLK-1 in cultured cells, an 
      inhibition that can be blocked by iron or cobalt cations, suggesting that chelation 
      is involved in the mechanism of action of clioquinol on CLK-1. We also show that 
      treatment of nematodes and mice with clioquinol mimics a variety of phenotypes 
      produced by mutational reduction of CLK-1 activity in these organisms. These results 
      suggest that the surprising action of clioquinol on several age-dependent 
      neurodegenerative diseases with distinct etiologies might result from a slowing down 
      of the aging process through action of the drug on CLK-1. Our findings support the 
      hypothesis that pharmacologically targeting aging-associated proteins could help 
      relieve age-dependent diseases.

TI  - A survey of antidepressant drug use in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson Study Group.
PG  - 1168-70
AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a newer class of antidepressants 
      that may have particular efficacy in Parkinson's disease (PD) given the known 
      serotonergic alterations in this disease. These agents are also thought to have a 
      favorable side-effect profile, particularly in the elderly. Several recent case 
      reports, however, have raised concern that SSRIs may worsen parkinsonian motor 
      function. We surveyed 71 Parkinson Study Group (PSG) investigators using a 
      standardized questionnaire about their usage of antidepressants in PD. Based on 
      estimates provided by 49 investigators (70%) (caring for approximately 23,410 PD 
      patients) who responded, 26% of patients with PD are on pharmacotherapy for 
      depression. These physicians use SSRIs as first line therapy 51% of the time, 
      tricyclic antidepressants 41% of the time and other agents 8% of the time. The most 
      common reasons for selecting SSRIs were their better side-effect profile and 
      perceived greater efficacy. The most common reasons for selecting tricyclic 
      antidepressants were their potential to help with sleep and the physician's 
      experience with this class. Forty-three percent of investigators were concerned that 
      SSRIs might worsen motor function, and 37% of them have had at least one patient in 
      whom they believe this had occurred. Our survey confirms that for treating 
      physicians there remain uncertainties regarding the relative efficacy and 
      tolerability of available antidepressant medications for patients with PD. A 
      controlled clinical trial of antidepressant therapy in PD would be valuable for 
      settling these concerns.

      dopaminergic neuronal cell.
PG  - 36717-32
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.492876 [doi]
AB  - Calpains are a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases that are ubiquitously 
      expressed in mammals and play critical roles in neuronal death by catalyzing 
      substrate proteolysis. Here, we developed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based 
      protease proteomics to identify putative calpain substrates. To accomplish this, 
      cellular lysates from neuronal cells were first separated by pI, and the immobilized 
      sample on a gel strip was incubated with a recombinant calpain and separated by 
      molecular weight. Among 25 altered protein spots that were differentially expressed 
      by at least 2-fold, we confirmed that arsenical pump-driving ATPase, optineurin, and 
      peripherin were cleaved by calpain using in vitro and in vivo cleavage assays. 
      Furthermore, we found that all of these substrates were cleaved in MN9D cells 
      treated with either ionomycin or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, both of which cause a 
      calcium-mediated calpain activation. Their cleavage was blocked by calcium chelator 
      or calpain inhibitors. In addition, calpain-mediated cleavage of these substrates 
      and its inhibition by calpeptin were confirmed in a middle cerebral artery occlusion 
      model of cerebral ischemia, as well as a stereotaxic brain injection model of 
      Parkinson disease. Transient overexpression of each protein was shown to attenuate 
      1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced cell death, indicating that these substrates may 
      confer protection of varying magnitudes against dopaminergic injury. Taken together, 
      the data indicate that our protease proteomic method has the potential to be 
      applicable for identifying proteolytic substrates affected by diverse proteases. 
      Moreover, the results described here will help us decipher the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying the progression of neurodegenerative disorders where protease activation 
      is critically involved.

TI  - Neuroprotective effects of oral administration of triacetyluridine against MPTP 
      neurotoxicity.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - Administration of triacetyluridine (TAU) is a means of delivering exogenous 
      pyrimidines to the brain, which may help to compensate for bioenergetic defects. TAU 
      has previously been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of Huntington's and 
      Alzheimer's diseases. We examined whether oral administration of TAU in the diet 
      could exert significant neuroprotective effects against 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity model of 
      Parkinson's disease. Administration of TAU significantly attenuated MPTP-induced 
      depletion of striatal dopamine and loss of tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive neurons in 
      the substantia nigra. These findings suggest that administration of TAU may be a 
      novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases associated with impaired 
      mitochondrial function.

AB  - The development of selective type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu5) 
      antagonists, such as 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) and 
      3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP), has revealed an important 
      role for these receptors in various disorders of the nervous system including 
      depression, anxiety, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, and alcoholism. 
      In this study, we used microarray technology to examine changes in gene expression 
      induced by repeated administration of the mGlu5 antagonists MPEP and MTEP. Male 
      Wistar rats (n=5 per treatment group) were administered MPEP (10 mg/kg), MTEP (10 
      mg/kg) or vehicle intraperitoneally twice daily for 5 days. Approximately 30 min 
      following the final drug administration, rats were sacrificed and frontal cortices 
      were then dissected and examined for changes in gene expression by cDNA microarray 
      analysis. Changes in gene expression with p-values less than 0.01 were considered to 
      be statistically significant. The expression of 63 genes was changed by both MPEP 
      and MTEP, with 58 genes down-regulated and 5 genes up-regulated. Quantitative PCR 
      verified the magnitude and direction of change in expression of 9 of these genes 
      (r2=0.556, p=0.017). Pathway analysis revealed that many of the biological processes 
      altered by repeated MPEP and MTEP treatment were related to ATP synthesis, hydrolase 
      activity, and signaling pathways associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK). Our results demonstrate diverse effects of MPEP and MTEP gene expression in 
      the frontal cortex, and these results may help elucidate the mechanisms by which 
      these compounds produce beneficial effects in animal models of various disorders of 
      the central nervous system.

TI  - Activation of p38 MAPK in the substantia nigra leads to nuclear translocation of

PG  - 1791-9

AB  - Activation and translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B 
      (NF-kappaB) from cytoplasm to the nucleus has been reported in models of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). Our focus was to discern the upstream events which ultimately lead to 
      NF-kappaB nuclear translocation using animal model of PD. We demonstrate that p38 
      activation results in downstream phosphorylation of NF-kappaB and accumulation of 
      p65 subunit of NF-kappaB selectively in ventral midbrain but not in striatum. 
      Treatment with p38 inhibitor, SB239063, prevented downstream phosphorylation of 
      IkappaB alpha and p65 translocation to the nucleus in the ventral midbrain. 
      Phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic Bcl2, an NF-kappaB target gene by p38 to inactive 
      pBcl2ser87 was also attenuated by SB239063. Increased staining of p65 in the nuclei 
      of cells in the substantia nigra but not in the ventral tegmental area of 
      MPTP-treated mice further suggests a role for NF-kappaB in PD. In agreement with the 
      above, sustained caspase activation is seen in the ventral midbrain but not in 
      striatum. We demonstrate the region specific p38-mediated activation of NF-kappaB 
      following MPTP treatment demonstrating the role of p38/NF-kappaB signaling in the 
      pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Selective inhibitors of p38 may 
      therefore, help preserve the surviving neurons in PD and slow down the disease 
      progression.

TI  - Glutaredoxin is essential for maintenance of brain mitochondrial complex I: studies 
      with MPTP.
PG  - 717-9
AB  - Mitochondrial complex I dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Identification of factors 
      involved in maintenance and restoration of complex I function could potentially help 
      to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for treatment of this class of 
      disorders. Down-regulation of glutaredoxin (thioltransferase, a thiol disulfide 
      oxido-reductase) using antisense oligonucleotides results in the loss of 
      mitochondrial complex I activity in mouse brain. 
      1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6,tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP), the neurotoxin that causes 
      Parkinson's disease-like symptoms in primates and dopaminergic cell loss in mice, 
      acts through the inhibition of complex I. Regeneration of complex I activity in the 
      striatum occurs concurrently with increase in glutaredoxin activity, 4 h after the 
      neurotoxic insult, and is mediated through activation of activating protein-1. 
      Down-regulation of glutaredoxin using anti-sense oligonucleotides prevents recovery 
      of complex I in the striatum after MPTP treatment, providing support for the 
      critical role for glutaredoxin in recovery of mitochondrial function in brain. 
      Maintenance and restoration of protein thiol homeostasis by glutaredoxin may be 
      important factors in preventing complex I dysfunction.

TI  - Neuroprotective Effect of the LRRK2 Kinase Inhibitor PF-06447475 in Human Nerve-Like 
      Differentiated Cells Exposed to Oxidative Stress Stimuli: Implications for 
      Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - 2675-2692
AB  - Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been implicated in oxidative stress (OS) 
      and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the pathophysiological 
      mechanism of the LRRK2 kinase in neurons under stress stimuli is not yet understood. 
      We demonstrate that rotenone (ROT), a mitochondria complex I inhibitor frequently 
      used to generate in vitro and in vivo experimental models of PD, induces LRRK2 
      phosphorylation at serine 935 p-(S935) concomitant with cell death in nerve-like 
      differentiated cells (NLCs). Indeed, ROT (50 µM) at 6 h exposure significantly 
      increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) (~100 %), p-(S935)-LRRK2 kinase 
      [~2 f(old)-(i)ncrease] level, induced nuclei condensation/fragmentation (16 %), 
      increased the expression of NF-κB (5.6 f-i), p53 (5.3 f-i), c-Jun (5.4 f-i) 
      transcription factors, activated caspase-3 (8.0 f-i) and AIF (6.8 f-i) proteins; but 
      significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ(m), ~21 %), indicative 
      of apoptosis -a type of regulated cell death process- compared to untreated cells. 
      Strikingly, the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor PF-06447475 (PF-475, 1 µM) protects NLCs 
      against ROT induced noxious effect. The inhibitor not only blocked the 
      p-(S935)-LRRK2 kinase phosphorylation but also completely abolished ROS, and 
      significantly reversed all ROT-induced apoptosis signaling and OS associated markers 
      to comparable control values. We conclude that wild-type LRRK2 may act as a 
      pro-apoptotic factor under OS stimuli. Our findings suggest an association between 
      OS and LRRK2 phosphorylation in the NLCs death process, as PD model. Therefore, the 
      pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 might help to understand the OS-mediated kinase 
      activation in PD neurodegenerative disorder.

TI  - Subthalamic nucleus local field potential activity during the Eriksen flanker task 
      reveals a novel role for theta phase during conflict monitoring.
PG  - 14758-66
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1036-13.2013 [doi]
AB  - The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is thought to play a central role in modulating 
      responses during conflict. Computational models have suggested that the location of 
      the STN in the basal ganglia, as well as its numerous connections to 
      conflict-related cortical structures, allows it to be ideally situated to act as a 
      global inhibitor during conflict. Additionally, recent behavioral experiments have 
      shown that deep brain stimulation to the STN results in impulsivity during 
      high-conflict situations. However, the precise mechanisms that mediate the 
      "hold-your-horses" function of the STN remain unclear. We recorded from deep brain 
      stimulation electrodes implanted bilaterally in the STN of 13 human subjects with 
      Parkinson's disease while they performed a flanker task. The incongruent trials with 
      the shortest reaction times showed no behavioral or electrophysiological differences 
      from congruent trials, suggesting that the distracter stimuli were successfully 
      ignored. In these trials, cue-locked STN theta band activity demonstrated phase 
      alignment across trials and was followed by a periresponse increase in theta power. 
      In contrast, incongruent trials with longer reaction times demonstrated a relative 
      reduction in theta phase alignment followed by higher theta power. Theta phase 
      alignment negatively correlated with subject reaction time, and theta power 
      positively correlated with trial reaction time. Thus, when conflicting stimuli are 
      not properly ignored, disruption of STN theta phase alignment may help 
      operationalize the hold-your-horses role of the nucleus, whereas later increases in 
      the amplitude of theta oscillations may help overcome this function.

TI  - Involvement of K(ATP)/PI (3)K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway in hydrogen sulfide-induced 
      neuroprotection against the toxicity of 1-methy-4-phenylpyridinium ion.
PG  - 442-9
LID - 10.1007/s12031-011-9608-1 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) produces protection in PC12 
      cells during 1-methy-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)) challenge. The present study 
      aims to clarify the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of H(2)S. We 
      showed that both glybenclamide, an ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel blocker, 
      and LY294002, a specific PI(3)K-AKT pathway inhibitor, reversed the neuroprotective 
      effect of NaHS (a H(2)S donor) against MPP(+)-induced cytotoxicity to PC12 cells and 
      that NaHS up-regulated the activity of AKT in PC12 cells, which was abolished by 
      blockade of K(ATP) channels with glybenclamide. In addition, NaHS up-regulated the 
      expression of Bcl-2 and blocked MPP(+)-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2, and this 
      augmentation of Bcl-2 expression was prevented by both glybenclamide and LY294002. 
      These data provided the evidence that the neuroprotective action of H(2)S against 
      MPP(+) toxicity to PC12 cells is via the K(ATP)/PI(3)K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway. We also 
      demonstrated that NaHS attenuated the inhibitory effect of MPP(+) ERK1/2 activation 
      in PC12 cells, whereas U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, did not reverse the 
      neuroprotective effect of NaHS, which indicated that attenuating MPP(+)-triggered 
      down-regulation of ERK1/2 activation is involved in the protection of H(2)S against 
      MPP(+) neurotoxicity, but ERK1/2 is not an essential effector mediating the 
      neuroprotective effect of H(2)S. In conclusion, the present observations identify a 
      crucial role of the K(ATP)/PI(3)K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway in H(2)S-exerted neuroprotection 
      against the toxicity of MPP(+). Findings from the present study will help shed light 
      on the mechanisms of H(2)S-elicited neuroprotective effects on MPP(+) toxicity.

TI  - Parkinson's disease: therapeutic choices and timing decisions in patient management. 
      Interview by Wayne Kuznar.
PG  - 44-9; quiz 50
AB  - Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      striatal dopaminergic loss. Carbidopa/levodopa is the most effective drug treatment 
      for disease management. It reduces bradykinesia and rigidity, but is less effective 
      against tremor. Whether carbidopa/levodopa should be used at the time of initial 
      diagnosis or delayed until symptoms become disabling is controversial. A clinical 
      trial is in progress to help resolve this dilemma. As carbidopa/levodopa loses 
      efficacy with continued use, adjunct therapies using catechol-O-methyl-transferase 
      inhibitors or dopamine agonists may be considered. In younger patients exhibiting 
      parkinsonian symptoms, dopamine agonists may be used as first-line therapy. A new, 
      reversible surgical intervention known as deep-brain stimulator placement is being 
      used to control disabling tremor in patients not responding to optimal drug therapy.

TI  - 14-3-3 inhibition promotes dopaminergic neuron loss and 14-3-3θ overexpression 
      promotes recovery in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 73-82

AB  - 14-3-3s are a highly conserved protein family that plays important roles in cell 
      survival and interact with several proteins implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      Disruption of 14-3-3 expression and function has been implicated in the pathogenesis 
      of PD. We have previously shown that increasing the expression level of 14-3-3θ is 
      protective against rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) in cultured 
      cells. Here, we extend our studies to examine the effects of 14-3-3s in the 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. We first 
      investigated whether targeted nigral 14-3-3θ overexpression mediated by 
      adeno-associated virus offers neuroprotection against MPTP-induced toxicity. 14-3-3θ 
      overexpression using this approach did not reduce MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell 
      loss in the substantia nigra nor the depletion of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites 
      in the striatum at three weeks after MPTP administration. However, 
      14-3-3θ-overexpressing mice showed a later partial recovery in striatal DA 
      metabolites at eight weeks after MPTP administration compared to controls, 
      suggesting that 14-3-3θ overexpression may help in the functional recovery of those 
      dopaminergic neurons that survive. Conversely, we investigated whether disrupting 
      14-3-3 function in transgenic mice expressing the pan 14-3-3 inhibitor difopein 
      exacerbates MPTP-induced toxicity. We found that difopein expression promoted 
      dopaminergic cell loss in response to MPTP treatment. Together, these findings 
      suggest that 14-3-3θ overexpression promotes recovery of DA metabolites whereas 
      14-3-3 inhibition exacerbates neuron loss in the MPTP mouse model of PD.

TI  - [Clinical features and treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies].
PG  - 1617-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging features 
      and treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). METHODS: The clinical, 
      neuropsychological, neuroimaging and therapeutic features of 33 DLB patients were 
      retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 25 males and 8 females. The mean 
      course from onset to diagnosis was 3.3 years. Sleep disorder, depression, anxiety 
      and constipation were present at 1 - 10 years prior to DLB onset in 10 patients. 
      Memory impairment (52%) and parkinsonism (21%) were initial symptoms. The mean 
      duration from memory impairment to presence of parkinsonism was 17 months. Pattern 
      of extrapyramidal signs showed bilateral, symmetry and axial muscles bias as 
      postural instability and facial impassivity, tremor was less in DLB. Hallucination 
      (70%), sleep disorder (63%), apathy (56%) and delusion (52%) were the major 
      behavioral and psychological symptoms. Hallucination occurred within a mean of 15 
      months after presence of initial symptoms. Cognition impairment progressed rapidly 
      in half of patients. Neuropsychological tests of mild patients revealed visuospatial 
      dysfunction and relatively preservation of memory. Severe impairment of all domains 
      of cognition was noticed in moderate-severe patients. MRI (magnetic resonance 
      imaging) revealed the preservation of hippocampal structures. And PET (positron 
      emission tomography) showed hypometabolism of occipital lobe. Cholinesterase 
      inhibitors could improve cognitive impairment and behavioral symptoms in a large 
      majority of patients. CONCLUSION: Neuronal dysfunction may be present at an early 
      stage of DLB. Early presence of hallucination, a high prevalence of sleep disorders, 
      axial rigidity and hypometabolism of occipital lobe on PET may help to distinguish 
      DLB from other types of dementia.

AB  - Mitochondria dysfunction, an enormous potential crisis, has attracted increasing 
      attention. Disturbed regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, the balance of 
      mitochondrial fusion and fission, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, 
      such as Parkinson׳s disease and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. However the role of 
      mitochondrial dynamics in traumatic brain injury (TBI) has not been illuminated. The 
      aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Mdivi-1, a small molecule 
      inhibitor of a key mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), 
      in TBI-induced cell death and functional outcome deficits. Protein expression of 
      Drp1 was first investigated. Outcome parameters consist of motor test, Morris water 
      maze, brain edema and lesion volume. Cell death was detected by propidium iodide 
      (PI) labeling, and mitochondrial morphology was assessed using transmission electron 
      microscopy. In addition, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins cytochrome c 
      (cyt-c) and caspase-3 was investigated. Our findings showed that up-regulation of 
      Drp1 expression started at 1h post-TBI and peaked at 24 h, but inhibition of Drp1 by 
      Mdivi-1 significantly alleviated TBI-induced behavioral deficits and brain edema, 
      reduced morphological change of mitochondria, and decreased TBI-induced cell death 
      together with lesion volume. Moreover, treatment with Mdivi-1 remarkably inhibited 
      TBI-induced the release of cyt-c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and activation of 
      caspase-3 at 24 h after TBI. Taken together, these data imply that inhibition of 
      Drp1 may help attenuate TBI-induced functional outcome and cell death through 
      maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and inhibiting activation of apoptosis.

TI  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 as a neuroprotective agent: 
      promotion of the morphological development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.
PG  - 435-46
LID - 10.1007/s12017-013-8230-5 [doi]
AB  - A greater understanding of the mechanisms that promote the survival and growth of 
      dopaminergic neurons is essential for the advancement of cell replacement therapies 
      for Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence supports a role for the mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase p38 in the demise of dopaminergic neurons, while mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which negatively regulates p38 activity, has 
      not yet been investigated in this context. Here, we show that MKP-1 is expressed in 
      dopaminergic neurons cultured from E14 rat ventral mesencephalon (VM). When 
      dopaminergic neurons were transfected to overexpress MKP-1, they displayed a more 
      complex morphology than their control counterparts in vitro. Specifically, 
      MKP-1-transfection induced significant increases in neurite length and branching 
      with a maximum increase observed in primary branches. We demonstrate that inhibition 
      of dopaminergic neurite growth induced by treatment of rat VM neurons with the 
      dopaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in vitro is mediated by p38 and 
      is concomitant with a significant and selective decrease in MKP-1 expression in 
      these neurons. We further show that overexpression of MKP-1 in dopaminergic neurons 
      contributes to neuroprotection against the effects of 6-OHDA. Collectively, we 
      report that MKP-1 can promote the growth and elaboration of dopaminergic neuronal 
      processes and can help protect them from the neurotoxic effects of 6-OHDA. Thus, we 
      propose that strategies aimed at augmenting MKP-1 expression or activity may be 
      beneficial in protecting dopaminergic neurons and may provide potential therapeutic 
      approaches for PD.

TI  - Worsening of motor function and mood in a patient with Parkinson's disease after 
      pharmacologic challenge with oral rivastigmine.
PG  - 296-9
AB  - Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can experience cognitive impairment. There 
      are currently no medications indicated for the treatment of cognitive impairment in 
      PD. Clinicians are faced with the dilemma as to whether or not to treat patients 
      with PD with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are currently approved for use 
      in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that have shown promise in clinical trials of 
      Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Although these medications may help cognition, 
      there is a theoretical concern that by increasing acetylcholine relative to 
      dopamine, they might worsen motor function. We report the case of a patient with PD 
      and cognitive impairment who developed a marked worsening of motor function, mood, 
      and anxiety in the setting of a pharmacologic challenge study using a 3-mg oral dose 
      of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine. We believe that the mechanism 
      of the motor and perhaps psychiatric worsening was increased central cholinergic 
      tone. We conclude that further studies should be done to evaluate the efficacy and 
      tolerability of these agents in this illness but that caution should be exercised 
      when using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PD.

TI  - Enhancement of tyrosine hydroxylase expression and activity by Trypanosoma cruzi 
      parasite-derived neurotrophic factor.
PG  - 167-75
AB  - A parasite-derived protein, PDNF, produced by the Chagas' disease agent Trypanosoma 
      cruzi, functionally mimics mammalian neurotrophic factors by delaying apoptotic 
      death and promoting survival and differentiation of neurons, including dopaminergic 
      cells, through the activation of nerve growth factor receptor TrkA. Because it is 
      well established that neurotrophic factors regulate enzymes involved in the 
      biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, we examined whether PDNF could also directly 
      activate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of 
      dopamine and other catecholamine neurotransmitters. We found that primary cultures 
      of rat ventral mesencephalon responded to PDNF by increasing the number of 
      TH-positive neurons and, most importantly, preserved expression of TH in neurons 
      treated with Parkinson disease-inducing neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium 
      (MPP(+)). In dopaminergic PC12 cells, PDNF induced TH transcription via CRE element 
      in TH promoter followed by significant increase in TH protein and expansion of 
      TH-positive cell population. Furthermore, PDNF stimulated TH enzymatic activity by 
      enhancing phosphorylation of seryl residues 31 and 40 through the activation of 
      MAPK/Erk1/2 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A signaling, respectively. Therefore, 
      our results indicate that PDNF, in addition to its functioning as survival and 
      differentiation-promoting factor for dopaminergic neuronal cells, can directly 
      influence activity of the rate-limiting enzyme that underlies catecholamine 
      biosynthetic cascade. This novel feature of PDNF should help understand the 
      mechanism of neuronal function altered by T. cruzi infection, specifically 
      neurotransmitter secretion. In addition, the findings have potential implications in 
      the therapy of Chagas' and other neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Reversal of levodopa-induced motor fluctuations in experimental parkinsonism by NMDA 
      receptor blockade.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Dopaminoceptive system alterations in the basal ganglia have been implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of wearing-off fluctuations that complicate levodopa therapy of 
      Parkinson's disease. To evaluate the contribution of glutamatergic mechanisms to the 
      associated changes in striatal efferent pathway function, we examined the ability of 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade to modify the motor response changes 
      produced by chronic levodopa administration to hemiparkinsonian rats. Unilaterally 
      6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats, given levodopa/benserazide (25/6.25 mg/kg) twice 
      daily for 3 weeks, developed a progressive shortening in the duration of their motor 
      response to levodopa similar to that occurring in parkinsonian patients with 
      wearing-off phenomenon. The acute systemic administration of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) to 
      these animals completely reversed the decrease in turning duration (P < 0.01). 
      Intrastriatal injection of the NMDA antagonist was even more effective in prolonging 
      the levodopa response (P < 0.01), while intranigrally injected MK-801 produced no 
      statistically significant change in the duration of levodopa-induced rotation. 
      Rotational intensity was unaffected by all routes of MK-801 administration. These 
      results suggest that drugs capable of blocking NMDA receptors, especially in 
      striatum, may help ameliorate motor fluctuations in patients with advanced 
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - The role of I-ioflupane SPECT dopamine transporter imaging in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies.
PG  - 287-92
AB  - The diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is difficult if one relies solely 
      on clinical features. Current International Consensus Criteria for DLB have high 
      specificity but a significant percentage of patients might be misdiagnosed. Reasons 
      for clinical uncertainty regard the presence of concomitant motor signs in patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease as well as the observation that cognitive abnormalities in 
      DLB might develop with memory impairment without significant parkinsonism. This has 
      clinical relevance as DLB patients may be particularly sensitive to antipsychotics 
      and even the effectiveness of atypical neuroleptics such as quetiapine for the 
      treatment of agitation and hallucinations has been questioned by double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, randomized studies. By contrast, acetyl-cholinesterase 
      inhibitors such as rivastigmine have shown benefit not only on cognitive but also on 
      psychiatric symptoms. Recent evidence shows that striatal dopamine transporter 
      binding of (123)I-ioflupane SPECT is reduced in DLB and this is consistent with a 
      significant loss of nigral dopamine neurons in this disorder. Several studies have 
      demonstrated the diagnostic accuracy of (123)I-ioflupane in the differential 
      diagnosis of parkinsonism. Given the availability of SPECT, this investigation 
      represents a useful marker to support clinical diagnosis and can help establishing 
      appropriate treatment for this disorder.

TI  - Cholinesterase inhibitor use does not significantly influence the ability of 
      123I-FP-CIT imaging to distinguish Alzheimer's disease from dementia with Lewy 
      bodies.
PG  - 1069-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: 123I-labelled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) 
      nortropane (123I-FP-CIT) imaging is a diagnostic tool to help differentiate dementia 
      with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in animals, 
      cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEi) have been reported to reduce radioligand binding to 
      the striatal dopamine transporter. As ChEi are frequently used in people with 
      dementia, it is important to determine whether their use affects 123I-FP-CIT uptake 
      in the striatum. OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether chronic ChEi therapy modulates 
      striatal dopamine transporter binding measured by 123I-FP-CIT in patients with AD, 
      DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). DESIGN: Cross sectional study in 99 
      patients with AD (nine on ChEi, 25 not on ChEi), DLB (nine on ChEi, 19 not on ChEi) 
      and PDD (six on ChEi, 31 not on ChEi) comparing 123I-FP-CIT striatal binding 
      (caudate, anterior and posterior putamen) in patients receiving compared with those 
      not receiving ChEi, correcting for key clinical variables including diagnosis, age, 
      sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score, severity of parkinsonism and concurrent 
      antidepressant use. RESULTS: As previously described, 123I-FP-CIT striatal uptake 
      was lower in DLB and PDD subjects compared with those with AD. Median duration of 
      ChEi use was 180 days. 123I-FP-CIT uptake was not significantly reduced in subjects 
      receiving ChEi compared those not receiving ChEi (mean percentage reduction: AD 
      4.3%; DLB 0.7%; PDD 6.1%; p = 0.40). ChEi use did not differentially affect striatal 
      123FP-CIT uptake between patient groups (p = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Use of ChEi does 
      not significantly influence the ability of 123I-FP-CIT imaging to distinguish AD 
      from DLB.

TI  - [Frontotemporal dementia: therapeutic possibilities].
PG  - 38-42
AB  - In order to treat frontotemporal dementia (FTD) we must first evaluate the patient's 
      medical condition, as well as his or her social setting (caregiver, financial 
      resources, home characteristics). Primary health-care team must receive information 
      about the patient's disease, and the family should be informed about the disease 
      itself and the social resources they can ask for. It is advisable to formulate a 
      therapeutic scheme including some counsels to improve the suitability of 
      environment, social help measures, behaviour therapy, cognitive stimulation and 
      pharmacological treatment. Atypical antipsychotics have improved "positive symptoms" 
      as logorrhoea, wandering, agitation and aggression, without impairing cognitive 
      function. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve depressive symptoms, 
      compulsions, food craving and disinhibition. A few reports suggest that idazoxan 
      (alpha 2-noradrenergic antagonist) can improve attention, verbal fluency and 
      planning efficiency. In some cases with "FTD and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 
      17" it could be justified to perform a genetic analysis to the offspring, in order 
      to know if genetic counseling is necessary. An inflammatory reaction has been 
      observed in brain damaged areas, and therefore antiinflammatory treatment efficacy 
      should be investigated. It would also be interesting to look for neuroprotective 
      agents that lessen the tau protein abnormality. All types of receptors which are 
      involved in FTD should be identified, and then their selective agonists or 
      antagonists could be administered in synergic combinations. We hope that all genetic 
      alterations producing or facilitating FTD are eventually known, and harmless 
      curative means are developed.

TI  - Structure-based functional design of chemical ligands for AMPA-subtype glutamate 
      receptors.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - Glutamate receptors (GluRs) function as transmembrane ion channels to regulate 
      intracellular level of ions such as calcium in control of excitatory synaptic 
      transmission of the central nervous system. Dysfunction of these glutamate receptors 
      has been implicated in human brain neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases. Despite such a significant role 
      in both the biology and pathology of the central nervous system, detailed 
      understanding of molecular mechanisms by which subtype- or subunit-specific 
      glutamate receptors function in cells is still lacking. The recently determined 
      three-dimensional crystal structure of the extracellular ligand-binding core of the 
      prototypic AMPA-subtype GluR2, in complex with its agonist, provides a new 
      opportunity for rational design of chemical ligands that could help elucidate the 
      underlying mechanisms and also be useful in the therapy of the neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Here we report our recent development in structure-based functional design 
      of chemical ligands by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR 
      structure-based method enables rapid identification of small molecular chemical 
      ligands that bind to specific sites of the target protein. These chemical compounds 
      can be optimized for selective binding to the target protein, and linked to produce 
      chemical ligands with high-affinity and selectivity of the AMPA-subtype glutamate 
      receptors.

TI  - Effects of catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibition on the rates of uptake and 
      reversibility of 6-fluoro-L-Dopa trapping in MPTP-induced parkinsonism in monkeys.
PG  - 363-71
AB  - The uptake rate constant and the loss rate constant that expresses the reversibility 
      of the uptake process of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-Dopa (FDOPA) were measured by positron 
      emission tomography in the striatum of normal rhesus monkeys and in monkeys with 
      unilateral lesions of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway, induced by 
      intracarotid injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Each 
      animal was studied twice: with and without pretreatment of the 
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor Ro 40-7592, tolcapone. After 
      pretreatment with tolcapone, there was a very significant increase in plasma FDOPA 
      throughout the course of the study, accompanied by a significant decrease in its 
      main metabolite, 3-O-methylfluorodopa. Tolcapone did not induce a significant change 
      in the uptake rate constant in either the normal or the MPTP-treated striatum. 
      However, after tolcapone pretreatment, there was a significant decrease in the loss 
      rate constant in the MPTP-treated striatum (25%) and a smaller, non-significant 
      decrease in the normal striatum (13%). It is concluded that the COMT inhibitor 
      tolcapone exhibits clear peripheral and central activity. As compared to peripheral 
      COMT inhibitors, this central effect may help preserve and stabilize the synaptic 
      levels of DA and, thus, further improve the effects of L-DOPA therapy in 
      parkinsonian patients.

TI  - Switching to duloxetine remits ziprasidone - associated urinary incontinence and 
      improves neuropsychiatric behavior in dementia: possible relationship of 
      incontinence to 5HT2 receptor blockade.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Urinary incontinence arising in dementia lowers patient quality of life, 
      predicts caregiver burden and nursing home placement, and predisposes to adding 
      additional medicines that can further impair cognition, behavior, and function. An 
      understanding of incontinence pharmacology can help the clinician predict and manage 
      this adverse event in treating patients with dementia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Case 
      report. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: We encountered a patient with Alzheimer's disease 
      and vascular dementia who developed urinary incontinence and parkinsonism when 
      ziprasidone was added to the regimen for behavioral concerns.When he was switched to 
      duloxetine, the incontinence and parkinsonism resolved whereas improvements in 
      perseveration, irritability, paranoia, and agitation persisted. CONCLUSIONS: While a 
      pharmacokinetic explanation is unlikely, the best evidence suggests that 
      ziprasidone-mediated serotonin 5HT2 receptor blockade may explain the reversible 
      incontinence, with an adrenergic alpha-1 receptor mechanism considered to be less 
      likely. Patients on 5HT2 antagonist drugs, including atypical antipsychotics, should 
      be observed for incontinence. In the event of incontinence developing in the context 
      of these agents, duloxetine may represent a potential pharmacological alternative in 
      some cases. Duloxetine may improve neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia through its 
      effects on serotonin, norepinephrine, and frontal dopamine.
